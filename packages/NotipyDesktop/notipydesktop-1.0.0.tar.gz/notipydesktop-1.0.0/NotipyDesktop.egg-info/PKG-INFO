# NotipyDesktop

NotipyDesktop is a simple Python library for sending desktop notifications using [libnotify](https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/).

## Features

- Send desktop notifications with a title and message.
- Easy-to-use API with just one function.
- Uses [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to interact with GNOME notifications.

---

## Installation

Install the library via `pip`:

```bash
pip install NotipyDesktop
```

---

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use `notifier`:

```python
from NotipyDesktop import notify

# Send a notification
notify("MyApp", "Test Notification", "This is a test message.")
```

### CLI Usage

You can also use the library as a command-line tool. Run the following command to send a notification:

```bash
python3 NotipyDesktop.py MyApp "Test Notification" "This is a test message."
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
