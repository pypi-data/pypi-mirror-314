- Run the script once, a config file `config.yaml` will be generated:

| **Operating System** | **Config Directory Path**                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows              | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\discord-music-rpc`                |
| macOS                | `~/Library/Application Support/discord-music-rpc` |
| Linux                | `~/.local/share/discord-music-rpc`                |

- Create a Discord application at <https://discord.com/developers/> (the name will be the text displayed in Listening to ...)
- Copy your Discord app's Application ID into `config.yaml`

- Add services:
  - Last.fm - create an API account at <https://www.last.fm/api/account/create> and copy your API key and fill out your username in `config.yaml`
  - Spotify - create an app at <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard> with a Redirect URI of <http://localhost:8888/callback> and copy the Client ID and Secret into `config.yaml`
  - SoundCloud - copy your token from your browser cookies after you've logged in (f12 -> Application -> Cookies -> soundcloud.com -> `oauth_token`) into `config.yaml`
  - Plex/Plexamp - [Get an auth token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/) and copy it into `config.yaml` along with your server URL

## disclaimer

This isn't really meant for public use _yet?_. Check out [discord-music-presence](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence) if you want a more fully-featured rpc client. It is closed-source though and only works with media players which report the currently playing song to the OS - i.e. not SoundCloud in browser, Plexamp or Last.fm.
