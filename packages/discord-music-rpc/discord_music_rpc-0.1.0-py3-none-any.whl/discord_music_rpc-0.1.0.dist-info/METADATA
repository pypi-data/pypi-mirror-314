## disclaimer

This isn't really meant for public use _yet?_. Check out [discord-music-presence](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence) if you want a more fully-featured rpc client. It is closed-source though and only works with media players which report the currently playing song to the OS - i.e. not SoundCloud in browser, Plexamp or Last.fm.
