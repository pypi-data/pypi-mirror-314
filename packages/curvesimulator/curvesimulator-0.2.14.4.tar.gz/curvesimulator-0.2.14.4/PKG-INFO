# CurveSimulator

**CurveSimulator: A Star System and Lightcurve Simulator**

CurveSimulator generates a video of the movements and eclipses of celestial bodies and the resulting lightcurve. This is especially useful for star systems that contain exoplanets detected using the transit method.

The video simultaneously displays a view of the star system from the top and from the side alongside the lightcurve of the system's total luminosity over time.

**Key Features**
- Produces videos with just 2 lines of Python code
- Fast video generation (about the same time as playing time)
- Efficient storage (less than 0.5 MB disk space per minute of video)
- Customizable via a configuration file
