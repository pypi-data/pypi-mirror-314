    Encode a datetime object into a SWMM datetime.

    The SWMM datetime is a float that represents the OLE Automation date
    format. The integer part of the float represents the number of days since
    12/31/1899. The decimal part of the float represents the fraction of the
    day. For example, 1.5 represents 1 day and 12 hours.
