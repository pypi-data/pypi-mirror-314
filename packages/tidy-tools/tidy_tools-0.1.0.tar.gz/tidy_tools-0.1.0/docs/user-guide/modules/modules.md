# Three Packages in One

Tidy Tools is a collection of three modules:
- core: packages recipes convenient for manipulating data
- frame: extends the PySpark DataFrame to include built-in logging
- models: introduces schema-level definitions of dataframes and workflows

By default, all modules can be used on their own without explicitly referring
to the others. However, when used together, PySpark workflows are simple yet
powerful.
