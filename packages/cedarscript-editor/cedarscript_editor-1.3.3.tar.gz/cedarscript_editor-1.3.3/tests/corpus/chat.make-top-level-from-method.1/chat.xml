Refactor the `_candidate` method to be a stand alone, top level function.

<assistant>
Here's my plan to implement the requested changes:
1. Move the `_candidate()` method from the `A` class, placing it at the top level, just before the line where its class starts;
2. Update the copied function to remove references to `self`;
3. Update ALL call sites of the method `_candidate()` to call the new top-level function with the same name;

Here's the CEDARScript script:

```CEDARScript
-- 1. Move the `_candidate()` method from the `A` class, placing it at the top level, just before the line where its class starts
UPDATE CLASS "A"
FROM FILE "main.py"
MOVE FUNCTION "_candidate"
INSERT BEFORE CLASS "A"
RELATIVE INDENTATION 0;

-- 2. Update the copied function to remove references to `self`
UPDATE FUNCTION "_candidate"
FROM FILE "main.py"
REPLACE LINE "def _candidate(self, a, b, c):"
WITH CONTENT '''
@0:def _candidate(a, b, c):
''';

-- 3. Update ALL call sites of the method `_candidate()` to call the new top-level function with the same name
UPDATE FUNCTION "_check"
FROM FILE "main.py"
REPLACE LINE "self._candidate("
WITH CONTENT '''
@0:_candidate(
''';
```
