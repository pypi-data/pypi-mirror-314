# Refactor BaseConverter.convert

Refactor the `convert` method in the `BaseConverter` class to be a stand alone, top level function.
Name the new function `convert`, exactly the same name as the existing method.
Update any existing `self.convert` calls to work with the new `convert` function.

When you updated method `decode` to replace line 2, your content block used "@1:".
Explain in details why the reference point is the method definition.
Don't change any code, just give me explanations

When updating call sites, use context-relative line numbers with the method being modified as context

Explain in deep details how you chose line number 3 to update method "encode": where do you start counting line numbers?
don't write any script, just answer my questions.

Explain in deep details why, when replacing the lines, you provided content with relative indent prefix = 1.
Just answer my question, don't change any code.

The relative indentation level is relative to the line, not relative to the class BaseConverter. Help me improve the
instructions I gave you earlier about CEDARScript to make it super clear and avoid this mistake in the future.


```CEDARScript
-- Move the `convert` method from the `BaseConverter` class, placing it at the top level, just before the line where its class starts
UPDATE CLASS "BaseConverter"
FROM FILE "1.py"
MOVE METHOD "convert"
INSERT BEFORE CLASS "BaseConverter"
RELATIVE INDENTATION 0;

-- Update the copied function to remove references to `self`
UPDATE FUNCTION "convert"
FROM FILE "1.py"
REPLACE LINE 1
WITH CONTENT '''
@0:def convert(number, from_digits, to_digits, sign):
''';

-- Update ALL call sites of the method `convert` to call the new top-level function with the same name
UPDATE METHOD "encode"
FROM FILE "1.py"
REPLACE LINE 3
WITH CONTENT '''
@0:neg, value = convert(i, self.decimal_digits, self.digits, "-")
''';
UPDATE METHOD "decode"
FROM FILE "1.py"
REPLACE LINE 3
WITH CONTENT '''
@0:neg, value = convert(s, self.digits, self.decimal_digits, self.sign)
''';

```
