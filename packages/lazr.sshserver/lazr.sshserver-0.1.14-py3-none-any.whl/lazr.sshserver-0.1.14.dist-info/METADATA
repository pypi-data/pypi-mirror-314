=======================
NEWS for lazr.sshserver
=======================

0.1.14 (2024-12-10)
===================

- Add support for Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.
- Drop Python 2 support and versions less than 3.8.
- Update linting.
- Remove old Makefile in favor of tox.

0.1.13 (2022-02-11)
===================

- Officially add support for Python 3.9 and 3.10.
- Add basic pre-commit configuration.
- Apply black code formatter.
- Add isort pre-commit hook.
- Apply inclusive naming via the woke pre-commit hook.
- Add support for RSA keys with SHA-2 signatures (given corresponding
  Twisted support).

0.1.12 (2021-09-13)
===================

- Adjust versioning strategy to avoid importing pkg_resources, which is slow
  in large environments.

0.1.11 (2020-10-27)
===================

- Officially add support for Python 3.8.
- Fix lazr.sshserver.auth.PublicKeyFromLaunchpadChecker on Python 3: Twisted
  passes the username in the credentials object as bytes.

0.1.10 (2019-10-30)
===================

- Stop using deprecated twisted.conch.checkers.SSHPublicKeyDatabase.

0.1.9 (2019-04-30)
==================

- Add Python 3 support.

0.1.8 (2018-07-02)
==================

- Add support-in-principle for authenticating using ECDSA or Ed25519 keys;
  this also requires a sufficient version of Twisted (which at the time of
  writing supports ECDSA but not Ed25519) and support in the Launchpad
  authserver.

0.1.7 (2018-02-26)
==================

- Fix regression in 0.1.5: restore support for unsigned queries for whether
  publickey authentication would be acceptable.
- Stop using deprecated PyCrypto-based attributes of
  twisted.conch.ssh.keys.Key.

0.1.6 (2018-02-26)
==================

- Handle the case where Twisted fails to load the user-supplied public key.

0.1.5 (2017-12-21)
==================

- Work around a bug in paramiko < 2.0.0: if the most significant byte of an
  RSA signature is zero, then it strips leading zero bytes rather than
  zero-padding it to the correct length.  This previously caused sporadic
  failures when running with Twisted >= 16.0.0, since cryptography is
  pickier about this than PyCrypto was.

0.1.4 (2015-11-29)
==================

- Require gmpy for better twisted.conch performance.

0.1.3 (2015-11-18)
==================

- Fix starting a lazr.sshserver.service.Factory with moduli_path=None.

0.1.2 (2015-11-18)
==================

- Add moduli file handling to lazr.sshserver.service, needed to support the
  diffie-hellman-group-exchange-* key exchange algorithms.

0.1.1 (2015-01-21)
==================

- Drop install-time dependency on bzr, although it is still required to run
  the test suite.

0.1 (2015-01-13)
================

- Initial release
