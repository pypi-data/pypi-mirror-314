PyDistSim is a Python package for event-based simulation and evaluation of distributed algorithms. It is a fork of the
deprecated `Pymote <https://github.com/darbula/pymote>`_.

This fork aims at providing new features, redesigned APIs and better documentation. It is being developed by Agustin
Recoba in the context of his grade thesis at `Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de la República <https://www.fing.edu.uy/>`_.

Definition of the distributed environment, entities and actions used for making PyDistSim are taken mainly from
`Design and Analysis of Distributed Algorithms <http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471719978,descCd-description.html>`_
by Nicola Santoro.

PyDistSim's main goal is to provide a framework for fast implementation, easy simulation and data-driven algorithmic
analysis of distributed algorithms.

Currently, PyDistSim supports IPython console or Jupyter notebooks. The gui is still in development and is not recommended
for any type of use.

\

PyDistSim is being developed on top of `NetworkX <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/>`_ and is meant to be used along other scientific packages such as SciPy, NumPy and matplotlib. Currently, gui runs on PySide (Qt bindings) and console is jazzy IPython.
