        :raises AssertionError: If the given value is not greater than the current average degree.

        This method increases the average degree of the network by modifying the communication range
        (`commRange`) of the nodes. It ensures that all nodes have the same communication range.

        The method uses a step-wise approach to gradually increase the average degree until it reaches
        the desired value. It adjusts the communication range of each node in the network by adding a
        step size calculated based on the difference between the desired average degree and the current
        average degree.

        The step size is determined by the `step_factor` parameter, which controls the rate of change
        in the communication range. If the step size overshoots or undershoots the desired average
        degree, the `step_factor` is halved to reduce the step size for the next iteration.

        Once the average degree reaches the desired value, the method logs the modified degree.

        Note: This method assumes that the network is initially connected and all nodes have the same
        communication range.
