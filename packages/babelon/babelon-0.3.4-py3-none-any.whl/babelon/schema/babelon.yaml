enums:
  translator_expertise_enum:
    permissible_values:
      DOMAIN_EXPERT: "The translator is an expert of the domain of the ontology, for example an expert in anatomy when translating terms from an anatomy ontology such as Uberon."
      LAYPERSON: "The translator is an interested lay person with no specific knowledge of the domain."
      DOMAIN_STUDENT: "The translator is a student of the domain of the ontology, for example a student of anatomy, when translating terms from an anatomy ontology such as Uberon."
      PROFESSIONAL_TRANSLATOR: "The translator is a professional translator by trade."
      ALGORITHM: "The translator is a machine, not a person."
      TECHNICAL_SPECIALIST: "The translator is a technical specialist, such as a software engineer, a bioinformatician or a data scientist."
  translation_status_enum:
    permissible_values:
      NOT_TRANSLATED: "This translation is incomplete."
      CANDIDATE: "The translation has been suggested from an entity (algorithm, person) outside the core team managing the translation."
      UNDER_REVIEW: "The translation has been suggested from an entity (algorithm, person) inside the core team managing the translation, but not yet officially ratified."
      OFFICIAL: "The translation has been accepted by the core team managing the language profile."
  translation_type_enum:
    permissible_values:
      TRANSLATION: "The record corresponds to an actual translation of a source value into a translation value."
      AUGMENTATION: "The record corresponds to an additional language specific terminological element without a corresponding element in the source language."
      CORRECTION: "The record corresponds to a translation of a source value into a translation value, but rather than being an exact translation, it suggests a change to the original source value."
  translation_precision_enum:
    permissible_values:
      EXACT: "The translation is exact."
      BROADER: "The translation value has a somewhat broader meaning than the source value."
      NARROWER: "The translation value has a somewhat narrower meaning than the source value."
      CLOSE: "The translation value is close in meaning to the source value, but not exact."

types:
 EntityReference:
    typeof: uriorcurie
    description: A reference to a mapped entity. This is represented internally as a string, and as a resource in RDF
    base: str
    uri: rdfs:Resource

slots:
  predicate_id:
    description: >-
      The predicate / annotation property used to relate the translated value at the source ontolgy.
      For example: rdfs:label, oio:exactSynonym, dc:description
    range: EntityReference
    mappings:
      - owl:annotatedProperty
    slot_uri: owl:annotatedProperty
  translation_value:
    description: The translation of the source value int the translation language. For example the french name of a disease.
    range: string
    slot_uri: owl:annotatedTarget
  profile_id:
    description: The persistent identifier of the profile, for example http://w3id.org/hpo-international/french.
    range: string
  profile_version:
    description: The version of the profile (e.g. 2.1, v2021-01-01).
    range: string
  source_value:
    description: The value that is being translated, for example the definition of a disease or the name of a cell type.
    range: string
  subject_id:
    description: The id of the entity to which the source value belongs, i.e. the subject of the annotation, for example HP:0000001.
    range: EntityReference
    mappings:
      - owl:annotatedSource
    slot_uri: owl:annotatedSource
  source_language:
    description: The language code of the source value, for example en-GB (see http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).
    range: string
  translation_type:
    description: By default, a record in a translation table is a direct translation, but there are situations where a translation may add additional values, like synonyms, without having a directly corresponding translated value.
    range: translation_type_enum
  translation_language:
    description: The language code of the translated value, for example fr (see http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).
    range: string
  source:
    description: The persistent identifier of the source, for example http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.owl.
    range: string
  source_version:
    description: The version of the source used for the translation, for example http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp/releases/2021-04-13/hp.owl.
    range: string
  translator:
    description: The entity that performed the translation, for example https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1373-XXXX or https://translate.google.com/
    range: string
  translator_expertise:
    description: The expertise level of the translator, e.g. domain expert or student.
    range: translator_expertise_enum
  translation_date:
    description: The date the translation was performed.
    range: string
  translation_confidence:
    description: A score between 0 and 1 to denote the degree of certainty the translator has with regards to the translation of the source value into the translation value, given a particular level of precision. For example, the translation may have precision "narrow" or "broad" rather than "exact", but the confidence that this is right may still be 100% (1.0).
    range: double
  translation_precision:
    description: While by default, all translations are assumed to be exact, this is not possible in all cases. Where the translations cant be exact, they can be close, narrow or broad.
    range: translation_precision_enum
  translation_provider:
    description: The entity, i.e. person or group, that provides and maintains the translation profile.
    range: string
  translation_status:
    description: The status of the translation indicates how "official" the translation is.
