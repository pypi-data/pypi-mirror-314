## Introduction

Concurrency and parallelism are really hard to get right.

The Python package space has great support for achieving

* concurrency in web applications (Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.)
* parallelism for distributed computing (Ray, Dask, etc.)

However, the solutions for _general-purpose_ data processing are less established.

Pyper aims to offer a comprehensive framework for concurrent and parallel data-processing in Python, designed with the following goals in mind:

* **Unified API**: Combine threads, processes and async code using one intuitive pattern
* **Functional Paradigm**: Data pipelines compose together flexibly as functions
* **Lazy Execution**: Built from the ground up to support generators, and provides mechanisms for fine-grained memory control
* **Error Handling**: Data flows fail fast, even in long-running threads, and propagate their errors cleanly
* **Complex Data Flows**: Data pipelines support branching/joining data flows, as well as sharing contexts/resources between tasks

In addition, Pyper provides an extensible way to write code that can be integrated with other frameworks like those aforementioned.

## Installation

Install the latest version using `pip`:

```console
$ pip install python-pyper
```
