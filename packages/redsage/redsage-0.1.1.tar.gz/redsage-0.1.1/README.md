# RedSage: Minimal Terminal Pair Programmer

**Author:** Warren Chisasa  

RedSage is a lightweight, terminal-based coding assistant that connects to LLM APIs (e.g., Claude, OpenAI) to provide real-time pair programming capabilities. Designed for developers seeking a simple yet powerful coding companion, RedSage focuses on **simplicity**, **ease of setup**, and **intuitive functionality**.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python Package Manager)
- `git`

### Install via pip
```bash
pip install redsage
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Setup

### 1. Initialize Configuration
Run the following command to initialize Redsage:
```bash
redsage init
```

### 2. Set API Key
Export your API key securely using environment variables:
```bash
export REDSAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Or update the `redsage.yaml` file with your API key:
```yaml
llm:
  provider: "openai"
  api_key: "your_api_key_here"
```

## 📖 Usage

### Start RedSage
```bash
redsage start
```

### Available Commands
- `/help` - Show available commands.
- `/context` - Display conversation context.
- `/suggest` - Get code improvement suggestions.
- `/explain` - Explain selected code.
- `/diff` - Show current changes.
- `/save` - Save changes to a git branch.
- `/undo` - Revert the last change.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `redsage.yaml` file in your project root for fine-tuned settings:
```yaml
llm:
  provider: "openai"  # or "claude"
  api_key: "${REDSAGE_API_KEY}"

watch:
  paths: ["./src"]
  ignore: ["*.pyc", "__pycache__"]

git:
  enabled: true
  branch_prefix: "redsage/"
```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Stored securely in environment variables or YAML files.
- **Local File Access Only**: Redsage doesn't transmit local code to external servers unless specified by the user.
- **Git Confirmation**: Git operations require user confirmation.
- **Sanitized Input Handling**: Redsage validates all inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## 🧩 Dependencies

- `watchdog`
- `click`
- `anthropic`
- `openai`
- `pyyaml`
- `gitpython`
- `prompt_toolkit`
