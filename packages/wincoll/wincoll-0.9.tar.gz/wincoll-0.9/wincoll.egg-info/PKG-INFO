# WinColl

https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll  

by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  

WinColl is a simple puzzle game in which you tunnel through caverns
collecting diamonds while avoiding being squashed by falling rocks. It is
based on [Repton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repton_(video_game)) (but
without eggs and monsters).

I originally wrote WinColl for Acorn RISC OS. Original and updated [RISC OS
versions](<https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll/RISC OS.md>) are available.
