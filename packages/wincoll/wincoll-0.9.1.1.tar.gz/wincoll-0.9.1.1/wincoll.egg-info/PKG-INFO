# WinColl

https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll  

by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  

WinColl is a simple puzzle game in which you tunnel through caverns
collecting diamonds while avoiding being squashed by falling rocks. It is
based on [Repton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repton_(video_game)) (but
without eggs and monsters).

I originally wrote WinColl for Acorn RISC OS. Original and updated [RISC OS
versions](<https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll/RISC OS.md>) are available.

The name of the game is an abbreviation of my school’s. “Repton” is also the name of a school, but I don’t believe the game was named after it!


## Credits

Level design and graphics also by Alistair Turnbull, Paul Smith and Jeremy
Douglas. Paul also designed the title graphic.

The sounds are from [Freesound](https://freesound.org), lightly adapted.


## Installation and use

Install with `pip`: `pip install wincoll`, then execute the command
`wincoll`. The game provides instructions on how to play.

You can edit the levels (the `.tmx` files) with
[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
