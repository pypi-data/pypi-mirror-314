# RomanEmpireReminder

## Description

## Why?

I made this project after remembering an old meme circling the internet in late 2023 where women would approach men and ask them how often they think about the Roman Empire. The meme was that if you were a man and didn't think of the Empire often enough, you would be considered feminine. Dumb, I know, but it spawned this beautiful program to remind you constantly so you don't end up too girly!

## Regarding PascalCase

This was originally written in C#, but I had such a hard time getting Microsoft's own libraries to work with Visual Studio that I decided to rewrite it in Python. Somehow, Python was much easier than using Microsoft's own tools (makes sense, right?), but I liked using C# so much that I wrote the Python script similarly to how I wrote the original script. So there you go, deal with it.

## Installation

Roman Empire Reminder is indexed in PyPi and can be installed with, for example, ```pip install roman-empire-reminder```.

Alternatively, you can run ```pip install path/to/clone``` to install from a local clone.

If for some reason that doesn't work, here is the list of requirements that the script uses:

```requirements.txt
datetime
pygame
pyttsx3

windows_toasts # Windows
dbus-python # Linux
```

The rest of the libraries required should be built into Python, but if not, please check the imports in the `__init__.py`, `__main__.py`, and `notification.py` files in `roman-empire-reminder`.

## How to Run

Run ```py -m roman-empire-reminder``` (Windows) or ```python -m roman-empire-reminder``` (Linux) in Command Prompt / a terminal emulator after installation.

Alternatively, run from the directory by executing `roman-empire-reminder/__main__.py` with python.
