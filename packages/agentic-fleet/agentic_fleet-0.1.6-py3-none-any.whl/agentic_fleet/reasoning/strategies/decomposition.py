Additional context: {context}

Let's break this down into smaller, manageable subproblems:

1. First, identify the main components or aspects of the problem
2. For each component:
   - Define it clearly
   - Identify its scope
   - List its dependencies
3. Consider:
   - Are there natural divisions in the problem?
   - What are the independent vs. dependent parts?
   - What order should these be solved in?

Break down the problem into 3-5 clear subproblems, each with:
- Clear definition
- Success criteria
- Dependencies on other subproblems
- Estimated complexity

Format each subproblem as:
Subproblem: [clear title]
Definition: [what needs to be solved]
Criteria: [how to know it's solved]
Dependencies: [what must be solved first]
Complexity: [simple/medium/complex]"""
