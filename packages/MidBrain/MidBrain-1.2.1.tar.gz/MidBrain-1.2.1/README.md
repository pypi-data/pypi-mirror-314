# MidBrain-CLI

MidBrain-CLI is a AI command-line interface tool that allows you to interact with powerful AI models for text generation. You can also run standard shell commands within the same interface!

## Features:
- **Text Generation**: Use powerful AI models to generate text based on your prompts (using models like GPT-2, GPT-J 6B, Mistral 7B).
- **Normal Shell Commands**: Run any normal shell command (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, etc.) within the same interface.
- **Interactive AI CLI**: Type commands interactively, with the option to prepend `midbrain` to invoke the AI text-generation feature.
- **Model Selection**: Select the AI model you'd like to use for generating text (GPT-2, GPT-J 6B, Mistral 7B).

## Info
GPT-2 might not give relevant information, we suggest you to try out other larger models. More models will be available in the upcoming releases.
