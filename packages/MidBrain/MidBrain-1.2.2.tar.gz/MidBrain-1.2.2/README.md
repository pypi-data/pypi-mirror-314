# MidBrain-CLI

V 1.2.2 MidBrain-CLI is a AI command-line interface tool now also comes with OpenAI that allows you to interact with powerful AI models for text generation. You can also run standard shell commands within the same interface!

## Features:
- **Text Generation**: Use powerful AI models to generate text based on your prompts (using models like GPT-2, GPT-J 6B, Mistral 7B).
- **Normal Shell Commands**: Run any normal shell command (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, etc.) within the same interface.
- **Interactive AI CLI**: Type commands interactively, with the option to prepend `midbrain` to invoke the AI text-generation feature.
- **Model Selection**: Select the AI model you'd like to use for generating text (GPT-2, GPT-J 6B, Mistral 7B).
