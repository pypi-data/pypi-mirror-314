This file divides the thalamic inhibitory cell densities into proportions between all thalamic inhibitory ME-types for each individual thalamic region that is present in the Atlas annotation. Each row of assignments must sum to 1.

Assigments are based on the proportions found in in-vitro recordings conducted for the following reference:
