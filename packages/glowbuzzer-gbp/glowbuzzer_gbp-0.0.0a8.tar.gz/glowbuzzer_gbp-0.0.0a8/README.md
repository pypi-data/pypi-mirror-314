# Glowbuzzer Python API (GBP)

This project contains the Python API for interacting with the Glowbuzzer Control (GBC).

Using this API you can connect to GBC and enable the machine, initiate moves and read inputs.

The API uses asyncio to handle asynchronous communications with the GBC. This allows you to interact with GBC in a
convenient and efficient way.

The project provides two examples:

1. [Simple Example](examples/simple/README.md)
2. [ROS2 Example](examples/ros/README.md)
