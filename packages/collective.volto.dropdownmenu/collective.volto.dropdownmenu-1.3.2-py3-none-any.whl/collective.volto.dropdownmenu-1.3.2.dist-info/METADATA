===================
Volto Dropdown Menu
===================

Add-on for manage a Dropdown menu in Volto.

Features
--------

- Control panel for plone registry to manage menu configuration.
- Restapi view that exposes these settings for Volto

Volto endpoint
--------------

Anonymous users can't access registry resources by default with plone.restapi (there is a special permission).

To avoid enabling registry access to everyone, this package exposes a dedicated restapi route with the infos to draw the menu: *@dropdown-menu*::

    > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/@dropdown-menu -H 'Accept: application/json'


Control panel
-------------

You can edit settings directly from Volto because the control has been registered on Plone and available with plone.restapi.


Volto integration
-----------------

To use this product in Volto, your Volto project needs to include a new plugin: https://github.com/collective/volto-dropdownmenu


Menu cache
----------

Restapi endpoint can took some time to reply if there are several items in the menu.

As first workaround, there is an environment variable to enable a ramcache for it (disabled by default)::

    environment-vars =
        DROPDOWNMENU_EXPERIMENTAL_CACHE 1

**USE THIS WITH CARE, BECAUSE STORED DATA COULD BE BIGGER THAN CACHE**

Translations
------------

This product has been translated into

- Italian
