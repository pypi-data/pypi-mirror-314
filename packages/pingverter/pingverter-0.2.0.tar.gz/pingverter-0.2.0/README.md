# PINGVerter
A Python-based convertor for sonar logs collected with consumer-grade fishfinders.

`PINGVerter` is designed to pre-process sonar logs for [PINGMapper](https://cameronbodine.github.io/PINGMapper/) post-processing. It is not intended

## Compatibility

- [Humminbird](https://humminbird.johnsonoutdoors.com/) ( *.DAT/ *.SON/ *.IDX)
- [Lowrance](https://www.lowrance.com/) ( *.sl2 / *.sl3)

## Installation


```bash
pip install pingverter
```

## Usage - Example Only

`PINGVerter` *can* be used as a stand-alone engine for decoding sonar logs and exporting ping attributes to CSV. While this functionality is described here, please use [PINGMapper](https://cameronbodine.github.io/PINGMapper/) for all sonar log processing.

### Humminbird
```python
# Import
from pingverter import hum2pingmapper

# Parameters
inFile = r'C:\Path\To\Recording\Rec00001.DAT'
projDir = r'C:\Path\To\Outputs\MyProject'

sonar_object = hum2pingmapper(inFile, projDir)
```

### Lowrance
```python
# Import
from pingverter import low2pingmapper

# Parameters
inFile = r'C:\Path\To\Recording\Rec00001.DAT'
projDir = r'C:\Path\To\Outputs\MyProject'

sonar_object = low2pingmapper(inFile, projDir)
```

Outputs from the above examples will be exported to `C:\Path\To\Outputs\MyProject\meta`.
