# DayZ Dev Tools

This project contains tools and libraries that can be useful for DayZ mod
developers and server owners, including:

* `guid` - Tool for converting 64-bit SteamIDs to DayZ GUIDs
* `pbo` - Tool for creating PBO archives
* `unpbo` - Tool for inspecting PBO archives and extracting their contents
* `run-server` - Tool that makes running DayZ Server easier

More information:

* [Documentation](https://dayz-dev-tools.readthedocs.io/)

## Installation

DayZ Dev Tools is listed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dayz-dev-tools/). I
highly recommend installing it using [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for
command line use:

```
pipx install dayz-dev-tools
```


It can also be installed with `pip` or using your preferred Python package
manager:

```
pip install dayz-dev-tools
```

DayZ Dev Tools can be run on Windows or Linux but Python 3.9 or higher is
required.
