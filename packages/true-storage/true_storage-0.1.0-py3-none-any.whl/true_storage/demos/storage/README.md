## Usage

Each demo can be run independently to showcase different aspects of the storage system:

```bash
python 01_basic_storage.py  # Basic operations
python 02_hot_storage.py    # Hot storage features
python 03_cold_storage.py   # Cold storage features
python 04_mixed_storage.py  # Mixed storage strategies
```

## Notes

- Hot storage demos use in-memory storage for fast access
- Cold storage demos create temporary directories for demonstration
- Mixed storage demos show automatic tiering between hot and cold storage
- All demos include proper cleanup of temporary resources
