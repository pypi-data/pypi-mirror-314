              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# RNUMPY: A JAX/Numpy Package to Write JAX-Optional Code with JAX Syntax

## What is RNUMPY?
**RNUMPY** is a Python package designed to let users write code in the JAX format while seamlessly falling back to NumPy if JAX is not installed. This enables developers to leverage the benefits of JAX speed when desired without requiring all users to overcome the challenges of JAX installation. It’s especially useful in scenarios where:

- **Portability**: You want your code to be usable by others who may not have JAX installed.
- **Ease of Use**: Users with simpler computational needs may prefer to avoid installing JAX.
- **Code Consistency**: You want a single codebase to work with either library.

### Use Cases
- Sharing JAX-like code with collaborators who face installation constraints.
- Writing reusable Python libraries that can flexibly work with JAX or NumPy.
- Prototyping JAX-based projects without committing to the full ecosystem immediately.

## Installation
To install RNUMPY, use pip. **This will not install JAX**. To install JAX as well, please see the official instructions here: [JAX Install](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

```pip install rnp```

## Usage Examples

### Example: Basic Operations
Original JAX code:
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

x = jnp.array([1, 2, 3])
y = jnp.array([4, 5, 6])

# Perform operations
dot_product = jnp.dot(x, y)
print(dot_product)
```
RNUMPY equivalent:
```python
import RNUMPY as rnp

# Compatible with both JAX and NumPy
x = rnp.array([1, 2, 3])
y = rnp.array([4, 5, 6])

# Perform operations
dot_product = rnp.dot(x, y)
print(dot_product)  # Output will match JAX
```

To use NumPy only:
```python
import RNUMPY as rnp

# rnp defaults to JAX unless told otherwise, change at anytime
rnp.use_jax = False

# Compatible with both JAX and NumPy
x = rnp.array([1, 2, 3])
y = rnp.array([4, 5, 6])

# Perform operations
dot_product = rnp.dot(x, y)
print(dot_product)  # Output will match NumPy
```

## Ethos
RNUMPY aims to be:

1. **A Drop-In for JAX**: All function calls and API structures mimic JAX’s documentation, ensuring that users familiar with JAX can transition effortlessly.
2. **Up-to-Date**: We strive to keep this package aligned with the latest JAX updates to maintain compatibility and feature parity.
3. **JAX-first functionality**: All functions will have JAX convention and functionality. In cases where numpy functionality differs, only the JAX functionality will be accessible.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you spot inconsistencies with JAX’s API, have feature requests, or want to help maintain parity with JAX updates, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## RNP Todos:

RNUMPY has all the basic JAX Numpy features, except the following, which are works in progress. There are no inherent technical challenges, this project is in a beta state. We welcome pull requests to finish these area.
- ufuncs
- mgrid/ogrids, c_, r_, s_
- bitwise operators
- isinf/isnan etc..
- Set Routines
- Most of the Scipy folder
We stubbed out these functions, so you will find a NotImplementedError if you try calling these.
