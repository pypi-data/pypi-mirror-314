==============
Volto Subsites
==============

This add-on enable a new **Subsite** content-type and provides some utilities for Volto.


Subsite
-------

It's a basic folderish content with some additional fields:

- Header text
- Footer text
- Color
- Image

These fields are useful for Volto theme that will draw some components based on these values.

**Subsite** contents are not searchable.

Accessing Subsite data from restapi
------------------------------------

There is a new expansion slot in restapi response when getting content data: `subsite`.

This expansion works like the standard ones (workflow, breadcrumbs, etc) and returns some metadata of the
parent Subsite if the requested content is inside a Subsite.

Control panel
-------------

There is a control panel that allows to set some settings for Subsites:

- Styles: you can set a predefined list of css classes that will be used in Volto theme to set some custom styles inside the subsite.
