! The above "Submission Date" is when the annotation project provided
! this file to the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC).  The "GOC Validation
! Date" indicates when this file was last changed as a result of a GOC
! validation and filtering process.
!
! Note: The contents of this file may differ from that submitted to the
! GOC. The identifiers and syntax of the file have been checked, rows of
! data not meeting the standards set by the GOC have been removed. This
! file may also have annotations removed because the annotations for the
! listed Taxonomy identifier are only allowed in a file provided by
! another annotation project.  The original submitted file is available from:
