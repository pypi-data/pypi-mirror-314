`sphinx-helm` is a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) plugin for automatically generating documentation for your [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/).

It will use the chart's `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` files in order to
generate the content in a markup language of your choice.

## Features

- Render documentation from your `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` files.
- Sphinx extension for including in Python documentation.
- Works with `rst` and `md` documentation source files.

## Installation

```console
$ pip install sphinx-helm
```

## Example

Create an example `hello-world` Helm chart with `helm create`.

```console
$ helm create hello-world
Creating hello-world
```

- Enable the plugin in your Sphinx ``conf.py`` file:

```python
extensions = ['sphinx-helm.ext']
```

- Now you can use the `helm` directive wherever you wish in your documentation.

```rst
.. helm:: path/to/hello-world
```

```{note}
sphinx-helm paths are relative to the root of your documentation.
```
   
## Example

*The following was autogenerated from the simple nginx example chart in sphinx-helm's test suite.*


```{helm} ../sphinx_helm/tests/mockcharts/simple

```
