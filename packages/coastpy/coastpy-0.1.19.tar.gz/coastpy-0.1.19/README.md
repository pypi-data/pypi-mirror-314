# CoastPy

Python tools for cloud-native coastal analytics.

## Installation

If you have all GDAL dependencies installed correctly you can install with pip:

```bash
pip install coastpy
```

although it's probably easier to install with conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

## Data

The data that is produced with this software can be directly accessed via the cloud using
tools like
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=cli&platform=macos&download_method=package_manager);
see the [tutorials](./tutorials/) and [analytics](./analytics/) other methods and latest instructions.

### Global Coastal Transect System (GCTS)

Cross-shore coastal transects are essential to coastal monitoring, offering a consistent
reference line to measure coastal change, while providing a robust foundation to map
coastal characteristics and derive coastal statistics thereof.

The Global Coastal Transect System consists of more than 11 million cross-shore coastal
transects uniformly spaced at 100-m intervals alongshore, for all OpenStreetMap
coastlines that are longer than 5 kilometers.


```bash
# Download all transects located in the United States.
duckdb -c "COPY (SELECT * FROM 'az://coclico.blob.core.windows.net/gcts/release/2024-08-02/*.parquet' AS gcts WHERE gcts.country = 'US') TO 'United_States.parquet' (FORMAT 'PARQUET')"
```

```bash
# Download transects by bounding box.
duckdb -c "COPY (SELECT * FROM 'az://coclico.blob.core.windows.net/gcts/release/2024-08-02/*.parquet' AS gcts WHERE bbox.xmin <= 14.58 AND bbox.ymin <= -22.77 AND bbox.xmax >= 14.27 AND bbox.ymax >= -23.57) TO area_of_interest.parquet (FORMAT 'PARQUET')"
```

```bash
# Or, download the data in bulk using AZ CLI
az storage blob download-batch \
    --destination "./" \
    --source "gcts" \
    --pattern "release/2024-08-02/*.parquet" \
    --account-name coclico
```

## Usage

More extensive installation and usage instructions will come when we build the
documentation. For now, to run the tutorials, analytics or scripts clone the repository,
install the [environment](environment.yaml) using a package manager like
[miniconda](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#download). You
may use Jupyter lab to explore the interactive content of the notebooks.

```bash
git clone https://TUDelft-CITG/coastpy.git
cd coastpy
mamba env create -f environment.yml
jupyter lab
```
