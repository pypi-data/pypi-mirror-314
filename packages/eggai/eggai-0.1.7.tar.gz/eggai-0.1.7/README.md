## üåü Features

- ‚ö° **Event-Driven Architecture**: Build systems that react to events in real-time.
- ü§ñ **Agent Orchestration**: Manage multiple agents with ease.
- üöá **Kafka Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Kafka topics.
- üöÄ **Async-First Design**: Designed for high-concurrency scenarios, long-running workflows and data streaming.

## üìñ Overview

`eggai` is a Python library that simplifies the development of multi-agent systems by providing a high-level abstraction over Kafka. It allows developers to focus on business logic while handling the complexities of distributed systems.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

![System Architecture](./docs/assets/system-architecture.svg)

1. **Human Interaction**:

   - Users interact with the system via various **Human Channels**, such as chat interfaces or APIs, which are routed through the **Gateway**.

2. **Gateway**:

   - The Gateway acts as the entry point for all human communications and interfaces with the system to ensure secure and consistent message delivery.

3. **Coordinator**:

   - The **Coordinator** is the central component that manages the communication between humans and specialized agents.
   - It determines which agent(s) to involve and facilitates the interaction through the **Agent Channels**.

4. **Agents**:

   - The system is composed of multiple specialized agents (Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent 3), each responsible for handling specific types of tasks or functions.
   - Agents communicate with the Coordinator through their respective **Agent Channels**, ensuring scalability and modularity.

5. **Agent and Human Channels**:
   - **Human Channels** connect the Gateway to humans for interaction.
   - **Agent Channels** connect the Coordinator to agents, enabling task-specific processing and delegation.

## üì¶ Installation

Install `EggAI` via pip:

```bash
pip install eggai
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

Here's how you can quickly set up an agent to handle events in an event-driven system:

```python
import asyncio

from eggai.agent import Agent
from eggai.channel import Channel

agent = Agent("OrderAgent")

@agent.subscribe(event_name="order_requested")
async def handle_order_requested(event):
    print(f"[ORDER AGENT]: Received order request. Event: {event}")
    await Channel().publish({"event_name": "order_created", "payload": event})

@agent.subscribe(event_name="order_created")
async def handle_order_created(event):
    print(f"[ORDER AGENT]: Order created. Event: {event}")

async def main():
    try:
        await agent.run()
        await Channel().publish({
            "event_name": "order_requested",
            "payload": {
                "product": "Laptop",
                "quantity": 1
            }
        })
        # Allow time for the event to propagate and handle
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Shutting down...")
    finally:
        # Stop the agent and any related resources
        await agent.stop()
        await Channel.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

This code demonstrates how to define an `Agent` and use it to process events from Kafka topics.

This repository contains a few applications you can use as a reference:

## üí° Core Concepts

### ü§ñ Agent

An `Agent` is responsible for subscribing to Kafka topics, processing events, and orchestrating tasks using user-defined handlers. The key features of the `Agent` class include:

- **Event Subscription**: Bind event handlers to specific events using the `subscribe` decorator.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Manage producer and consumer lifecycles seamlessly.
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Focus on business logic without worrying about Kafka details.

### üöá Channel

A `Channel` abstracts the Kafka producer interface to publish events to specific Kafka topics. Key features include:

- **Event Publishing**: Send events to Kafka topics easily.
- **Singleton Producers**: Manage Kafka producers efficiently across multiple channels.
