Python client for [IOLite's][0] remote API.

The client has basic functionality such as the authentication layer, some basic command models, and a client to change the
heating intervals are available.

Build by reverse engineering the [Deutsche Wohnen][2] [MIA Android App][1] and subsequently their remote API.

Read the following [short post][3] on how that was achieved.

Used in making the [IOLite Custom Component](https://github.com/inverse/home-assistant-iolite-component) for Home Assistant.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.7+
-   [Poetry][4]

## Getting credentials

Open your Deutsche Wohnen tablet and begin pairing device process. Scan the QR code with your QR-Scanner and instead of
opening the QR code in your browser, copy it's content. You'll get the following payload:

```json
{
  "webApp": "/ui/",
  "code": "<redacted>",
  "basicAuth": "<redacted>"
}
```

-   `basicAuth` contains base64 encoded HTTP basic username and password. Decode this to get the `:` separated `user:pass`.
-   `code` is the pairing code

You can decode the credentials using the `scripts/get_credentials.py` script. e.g.

```bash
 python scripts/get_credentials.py '{"webApp":"/ui/","code":"<redacted>","basicAuth":"<redacted>"}'
```

## Development

-   Init your virtualenv environment (`poetry install`)
-   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
-   Decode credentials (`poetry run python scripts/get_credentials.py <basic-auth-value>`)
-   Add your credentials to `.env` following the above process

The [pre-commit][5] framework is used enforce some linting and style compliance on CI.

To get the same behaviour locally you can run `pre-commit install` within your activated venv.

Alternatively to run manually you can run `pre-commit run -a`.

## Access remote UI

Run `poetry run python scripts/example.py` and copy the URL to your browser of choice.

You will need the HTTP basic credentials you defined earlier within the `.env` file.

Be sure to run `poetry install -E dev` to get the required dependencies for this.

## Usage example

A jupyter notebook showcasing the heating interval scheduler can be found in `notebooks/Heating Scheduler.ipynb`. To
access the notebook install [jupyter notebook or jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/install.html) into the virtual environment and run the notebook:

```sh
poetry shell
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

If running the notebook gives you a `ModuleNotFoundError`, you may fix this issue by changing the notebook's kernel (following [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47296960/50913)):

```sh
poetry shell
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=`basename $VIRTUAL_ENV`
```

Then switch the kernel in the notebook's top menu under: _Kernel > Change Kernel_.
