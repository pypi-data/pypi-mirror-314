# Easy-Git CLI Tool

**Easy-Git** is a command-line tool designed to simplify and streamline common Git workflows, making it easier and faster to interact with Git repositories. This tool is particularly useful for developers who want to automate repetitive tasks like staging files, committing changes, and pushing to remote repositories.

Currently, **Easy-Git** includes the following features:
- **Quick Commit**: A streamlined process for staging, committing, and pushing changes to the repository.
- **Shortcuts for Commands**: You can use both `quick-commit` and `c` to trigger the same functionality.
- More features coming soon!

> **Note**: This project is a work in progress and will be extended with more tools and functionalities over time. Stay tuned for more features!
