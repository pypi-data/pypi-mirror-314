"""
This optimization runs toward the end of the set, it removes operators which
were useful during planning and optimization.

- Some projections are redundant (reselecting down to the columns which the
  providing operation has already limited down to).
- SubQuery nodes are useful for planning and optimization, but don't do
  anything during execution, we can remove them here.

Both of these operations are cheap to execute, the benefit for this
optimization isn't expected to be realized until we implement multiprocessing
and there is work associated with IPC which we are avoiding by removing
impotent steps.
