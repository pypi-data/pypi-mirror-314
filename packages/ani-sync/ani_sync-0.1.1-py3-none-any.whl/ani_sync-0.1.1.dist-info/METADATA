# ani-sync README

Welcome to **ani-sync**, the syncing tool I made to keep my anime watch progress consistent across devices. Honestly, this was a personal project that got slightly out of hand. Expect some rough edgesâ€”itâ€™s not perfect, and I wonâ€™t pretend it is. 99% was ChatGPT's work. If it works for you, great! If not, wellâ€¦ it works on my machine

## Features

- **Sync Your Progress**: Keep track of what youâ€™ve watched with ani-cli across your PC, phone or other devices (samsung smart fridge maybe?).
- **Cloud Storage**: Syncs progress to a remote server by default (`ani-sync.hamzie.site:25507`).
- **Arguments Compatibility**: Run `ani-sync` with the same arguments as `ani-cli` and more.
- **Open Source**: Both the client and server are open-source because trust matters.

## How It Works

ani-sync acts as a wrapper around ani-cli, handling syncing automatically before and after your anime sessions. By default, it uses `ani-sync.hamzie.site` to store and authenticate your data. The server saves your progress as plain text filesâ€”yes, I could *technically* read them, but I donâ€™t care about your anime habits. Youâ€™ll just have to trust me the same way you trust big corporations. But Iâ€™ve got better things to do then look what episode you are at on Naruto. 

If youâ€™re privacy-focused (for anime? really?), you can host your own server. Check out the server code here: [Hamziee/ani-sync-server](https://github.com/Hamziee/ani-sync-server). (don't expect anything good)

## Setup & Installation

### Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamziee/ani-sync.git
cd ani-sync
pip install .
```

### Requirements:
- **ani-cli** installed and in your PATH
- Python 3.x
- Git Bash (Windows users) (you should have this already if u installed ani-cli correctly, if not, then, okay, how are you using it???)

## Usage

**Basic Sync Flow:**

1. If youâ€™ve been using ani-cli already, first upload your progress:
   ```bash
   ani-sync --- --upload
   ```
2. After that, just run:
   ```bash
   ani-sync
   ```
   Itâ€™ll handle syncing automatically.

**Commands:**

- **Register an account:**
  ```bash
  ani-sync --- --register
  ```
- **Log in:**
  ```bash
  ani-sync --- --login
  ```
- **Upload progress:** [!] This is done automatically after you finished watching and clicked quit in ani-cli
  ```bash
  ani-sync --- --upload
  ```
- **Download progress:** [!] This is done automatically when you start it
  ```bash
  ani-sync --- --download
  ```

**Passing Arguments:**

- Pass ani-cli arguments directly:
  ```bash
  ani-sync -c --dub
  ```
- Pass ani-sync arguments with `---`:
  ```bash
  ani-sync --- --upload
  ```

## FAQ

### Q: Is this stable?
A: Define stable

### Q: Can I trust this?
A: You trust big corporations with your data, donâ€™t you? This is no differentâ€”just smaller scale and open source and anime which is not really personal data.

### Q: What if I donâ€™t trust anyone?
A: Sure, grab the server code here: [Hamziee/ani-sync-server](https://github.com/Hamziee/ani-sync-server) and host it yourself, you got something to hide huh?
