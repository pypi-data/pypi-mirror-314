ae.deep module
in the currently active virtual environment:

```

if you want to contribute to this portion then first fork
[the ae_deep repository at GitLab](

after that pull it to your machine and finally execute the
following command in the root folder of this repository
(ae_deep):

```shell script
pip install -e .[dev]
```

the last command will install this module portion, along with the tools you need
