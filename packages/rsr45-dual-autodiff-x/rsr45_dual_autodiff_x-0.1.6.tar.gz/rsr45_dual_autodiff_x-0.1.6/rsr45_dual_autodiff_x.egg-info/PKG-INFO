## Installation

### Using pip
Install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install rsr45-dual-autodiff-x
```
---

## Usage

### Importing the Package

To use the package:
```python
import dual_autodiff as df
from dual_autodiff.dual import Dual
from dual_autodiff.functions import sin, cos, log
```

### Creating Dual Numbers
```python
x = Dual(2, 1)  # Represents the dual number 2 + 1Îµ
```

### Performing Operations
```python
# Example: f(x) = log(sin(x)) + x^2 * cos(x)
f_x = log(sin(x)) + x**2 * cos(x)
print(f_x)  # Output the result and its derivative
```
