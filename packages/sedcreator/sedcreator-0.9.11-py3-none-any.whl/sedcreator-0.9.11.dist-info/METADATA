Metadata-Version: 2.1
Name: sedcreator
Version: 0.9.11
Summary: sedcreator is a package that has two main classes, SedFluxer and SedFitter. SedFluxer performs aperture photometry on a given image, coordinates and aperture size. It has a number of functions to print useful information and to plot the image together with apertures. SedFitter fits observations to a grid of models following the Zhang and Tan (2018) radiative transfer models.

# sedcreator

**sedcreator** helps you to construct your spectral energy distribution
by providing tools to measure fluxes on any image. It also provides a set
of models to fit your SED with massive star formation models.
It is an open source Python package.
