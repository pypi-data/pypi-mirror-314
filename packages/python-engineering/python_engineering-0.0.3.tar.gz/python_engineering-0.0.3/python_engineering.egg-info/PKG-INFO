Python Engineering

This package contains Python functions for engineering applications.

python-engineering bundles a large amount of knowledge and provides it to end users through extensively documented functions. The aim of the package is as follows:

   - Improve correctness through unit-tested functions with parameter validation
   - Raise awareness on underlying test data and theories supporting engineering correlations and design formulae
   - Promoting development of open-source engineering software by the worldwide community of engineers

python-engineering is developed using a set of 10 Golden rules which are reflected in the python-engineering function
architecture and should also be followed by any contributors to the project.

Installation requirements
-------------------------

python-engineering is written for Python 3.x. Downloading Anaconda3 is recommended for users not familiar with Python development.
