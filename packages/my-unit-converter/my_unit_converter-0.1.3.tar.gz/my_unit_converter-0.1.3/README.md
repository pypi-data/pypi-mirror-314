Here's an example of a `README.md` file for your unit converter library:

# Unit Converter Library

A versatile and easy-to-use library for converting between different units in various categories, including length, weight, temperature, volume, time, area, speed, energy, and power.

## Features

- Supports conversions between common units in multiple categories.
- Provides a simple API for integrating unit conversions into any application.
- Easy to extend with additional units or categories if needed.

## Installation

You can install the library as a package:

### Python

To install via `pip`, simply use the following command:

```bash
pip install unit-converter-library
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unit-converter-library.git
cd unit-converter-library
python setup.py install
```

### Java

For Java, include the compiled JAR file in your project's dependencies or include it via a build system like Maven or Gradle.

## Example Usage

### Python

To use the library, import the appropriate conversion method and call it with your desired values.

```python
from unit_converter import converter

# Convert 100 meters to kilometers
result = converter.convert_length(100, 'meters', 'kilometers')
print(f"100 meters is equal to {result} kilometers")

# Convert 100 Celsius to Fahrenheit
result = converter.convert_temperature(100, 'C', 'F')
print(f"100 Celsius is equal to {result} Fahrenheit")
```

### Java

In Java, you can use the library by importing the `UnitConverter` class and calling the conversion methods.

```java
import com.yourcompany.unitconverter.UnitConverter;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Convert 100 meters to kilometers
        double result = UnitConverter.convertLength(100, "meters", "kilometers");
        System.out.println("100 meters is equal to " + result + " kilometers");

        // Convert 100 Celsius to Fahrenheit
        double tempResult = UnitConverter.convertTemperature(100, "C", "F");
        System.out.println("100 Celsius is equal to " + tempResult + " Fahrenheit");
    }
}
```

## Available Conversion Methods

### Length

- `convert_length(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between length units like meters, kilometers, miles, feet, and inches.

### Weight

- `convert_weight(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between weight units like kilograms, grams, pounds, and ounces.

### Temperature

- `convert_temperature(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between temperature units like Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

### Volume

- `convert_volume(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between volume units like liters, milliliters, gallons, and cups.

### Time

- `convert_time(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between time units like seconds, minutes, hours, and days.

### Area

- `convert_area(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between area units like square meters, square kilometers, square miles, square feet, and acres.

### Speed

- `convert_speed(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between speed units like meters per second, kilometers per hour, and miles per hour.

### Energy

- `convert_energy(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between energy units like joules, calories, and kilocalories.

### Power

- `convert_power(value, from_unit, to_unit)`  
  Convert between power units like watts and horsepower.

## Assumptions

- The conversion logic assumes the input values are valid and correctly formatted.
- Units are case-insensitive. For example, "meters" and "METERS" will be treated the same.
- The library currently supports basic units and does not handle custom unit conversions unless added.

## Limitations

- The library does not support temperature conversions between Fahrenheit and Kelvin (direct conversions).
- Currently, only standard units are supported; custom units need to be manually added to the source code.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to add new units or categories, or fix any bugs, please fork the repository and create a pull request.
