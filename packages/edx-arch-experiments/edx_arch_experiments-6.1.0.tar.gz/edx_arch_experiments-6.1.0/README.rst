A plugin to include applications under development by and useful utility scripts for the architecture team at 2U.

Overview
------------------------

This plugin is meant to house experimental and in-development applications from the edX architecture team at 2U that are either not appropriate (i.e. 2U-specific) or not yet ready for community consumption.
It also includes some one-off scripts meant to reduce toil for the team.

Development Workflow
--------------------

One Time Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:edx/edx-arch-experiments.git
  cd edx-arch-experiments

  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.11 edx-arch-experiments

Local testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two options are available for testing changes locally:

First, via `make test-shell` a dockerized development envrionment can be launched to run `pytest` and do basic migration work.

Second, a local copy of the package can be installed into edx-platform. For example, if using devstack, copy or clone your branch into <devstack-parent>/src/edx-arch-experiments. Then, in an lms or cms shell, run ``pip install -e /edx/src/edx-arch-experiments``.  The plug-in configuration will automatically be picked up once installed, and changes will be hot reloaded.
