edx-arch-experiments
====================

|pypi-badge| |ci-badge| |codecov-badge| |pyversions-badge|
|license-badge|

A plugin to include applications under development by and useful utility scripts for the architecture team at 2U.

Overview
------------------------

This plugin is meant to house experimental and in-development applications from the edX architecture team at 2U that are either not appropriate (i.e. 2U-specific) or not yet ready for community consumption.
It also includes some one-off scripts meant to reduce toil for the team.

Development Workflow
--------------------

One Time Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:edx/edx-arch-experiments.git
  cd edx-arch-experiments

  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.11 edx-arch-experiments

Local testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two options are available for testing changes locally:

First, via `make test-shell` a dockerized development envrionment can be launched to run `pytest` and do basic migration work.

Second, a local copy of the package can be installed into edx-platform. For example, if using devstack, copy or clone your branch into <devstack-parent>/src/edx-arch-experiments. Then, in an lms or cms shell, run ``pip install -e /edx/src/edx-arch-experiments``.  The plug-in configuration will automatically be picked up once installed, and changes will be hot reloaded.


Every time you develop something in this repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

  # Activate the virtualenv
  workon edx-arch-experiments

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make validate

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  vim …

  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit …
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.

Unreleased
~~~~~~~~~~

[6.1.0] - 2024-12-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed
_______
* Completes code owner monitoring updates, which drops owner theme and finalizes the code owner span tags. See doc and ADR updates for more details.

    * The code_owner_theme_2 tag was dropped altogether.
    * The temporary suffix (_2) was removed from other span tags.
    * The code_owner (formerly code_owner_2) tag no longer includes the theme name.
    * The new name for the django setting is CODE_OWNER_TO_PATH_MAPPINGS (formerly CODE_OWNER_MAPPINGS).
    * The django setting CODE_OWNER_THEMES was dropped.
    * Updates the generate_code_owner_mappings.py script accordingly.

[6.0.0] - 2024-12-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed
-------
- Removes CodeOwnerMonitoringMiddleware, in favor of using new signals sent from edx-django-utils's MonitoringSupportMiddleware.

Added
-----
* Adds search script datadog_search.py, for searching Datadog monitors and dashboards.

[5.1.0] - 2024-11-21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added
-----
* Added Datadog monitoring app which adds code owner monitoring. This is the first step in moving code owner code from edx-django-utils to this plugin.

  * Adds near duplicate of code owner middleware from edx-django-utils.
  * Adds code owner span tags for celery using Datadog span processing of celery.run spans.
  * Uses temporary span tags names using ``_2``, like ``code_owner_2``, for rollout and comparison with the original span tags.
  * Span tag code_owner_2_module includes the task name, where the original code_owner_module does not. In both cases, the code owner is computed the same, because it is based on a prefix match.

[5.0.0] - 2024-10-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed
-------
* Deleted Datadog diagnostics plugin app and middleware, which are no longer in use in edxapp.

[4.5.0] - 2024-09-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added
-----
* Datadog diagnostics middleware can now attempt to close anomalous spans. Can be enabled via Waffle flag ``datadog.diagnostics.close_anomalous_spans`` (controlled separately from logging feature).

[4.4.0] - 2024-09-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed
-------
* Datadog diagnostics now logs ancestor spans when an anomaly is encountered, up to a limit of 10 (controlled by new Django setting ``DATADOG_DIAGNOSTICS_LOG_SPAN_DEPTH``). Spans are logged in full and on separate lines, so this logging is now much more verbose; consider only enabling this logging for short periods. Log format of first line has also changed slightly.

[4.3.0] - 2024-08-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added
-----
* Added celery lifecycle logging for Datadog diagnostics, to be enabled using ``DATADOG_DIAGNOSTICS_CELERY_LOG_SIGNALS``.

[4.2.0] - 2024-08-13
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed
-----
* Fixed loading of ``DATADOG_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLE``, which was previously not loaded properly and therefore was always True. Also fixed loading of ``DATADOG_DIAGNOSTICS_MAX_SPANS``, which was presumably broken as well.

Removed
-------
* Removed early span-start logging. It never worked properly, possibly because workers are continually being destroyed and created, leading to high log volume.

[4.1.0] - 2024-08-09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed
-------
* Datadog diagnostics will now log all span-starts for the first minute after server startup
* **WARNING**: Do not use this version; see 4.2.0 release notes.

[4.0.0] - 2024-08-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed
-------
* Dropped support for Python 3.8; only testing with 3.11 and above now.

Added
-----
* ``DatadogDiagnosticMiddleware`` can now detect and log anomalous traces, enabled by Waffle flag ``datadog.diagnostics.detect_anomalous_trace``

[3.6.0] - 2024-07-24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added
-----
* New middleware ``edx_arch_experiments.datadog_diagnostics.middleware.DatadogDiagnosticMiddleware`` for logging diagnostics on traces in Datadog.

[3.5.1] - 2024-07-15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed
-------
* Added ``federated-content-connector`` to the generate_code_owners script.

[3.5.0] - 2024-07-11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added
-----
* Toggle ``DATADOG_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLE`` for disabling that plugin quickly if needed. (Feature remains enabled by default.)

Fixed
-----
* Limit the number of spans collected via new setting ``DATADOG_DIAGNOSTICS_MAX_SPANS``, defaulting to 100. This may help avoid memory leaks.
* Make accidental class variables into member variables in ``datadog_diagnostics``

[3.4.0] - 2024-07-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added
-----
* Added ``datadog_diagnostics`` plugin app

[3.3.2] - 2024-04-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed

[3.2.0] - 2024-01-11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added
_____
* Add ``codejail_service`` app for transition to containerized codejail

[3.1.1] - 2023-11-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed
_____
* ConfigWatcher should now respond to model events properly now that it registers receivers with strong references. (Tested in sandbox.)

[3.1.0] - 2023-10-31
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
_______

* Add log message for each model the ConfigWatcher is listening to
* Ensure that ConfigWatcher only attaches receivers once

[3.0.0] - 2023-10-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
_______
