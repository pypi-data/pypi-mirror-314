# Durable Asset Observability (DAO)

DAO is an Asset Observability platform. It allows you to understand the health and status of assets by querying Event and Asset data in your data warehouse using a domain-specific query language: DAOQL.

## Installation and Usage

DAO has two components: a server, and clients.

### Run the Server

Assuming you have Docker installed and running, get the latest DAO docker image:

```sh
docker pull viaductai/dao:latest
```

Then start the DAO container:

```sh
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -it -p 9090:9090 -v dao-data:/data --name dao viaductai/dao:latest
```

Once startup completes, you can access the DAO server at <http://localhost:9090>.

This will start the dao server, expose it on port 9090, and persist data in the `dao-data` docker volume across container restarts.

### Python Client

With the server up and running, you can interact with it via the `viaduct-dao` python package.

You can install the `viaduct-dao` python package to interact with a DAO server via python (ie in jupyterhub, or your laptop).

Install the dao python package (e.g. in your terminal, or venv):

```sh
pip install viaduct-dao
```

and use it via python - here, we load some example datasets that are included with dao:

```python
from viaduct.dao.client import get_client, daoql, BasicAuthPlugin
from viaduct.dao.v1 import dao_pb2
from viaduct.dao.examples import load_examples
import pandas as pd


# Authenticate
client = get_client("localhost:9090", secure=False, auth_plugin=BasicAuthPlugin())

# Load example data
load_examples(client)

# Show example DataSources
client.ListDataSources(dao_pb2.ListDataSourcesRequest())

# Query
daoql(client, """
assets()
""", limit=100)

df = pd.DataFrame(daoql(client, """
events()
""", limit=100))
```

### Example Data

DAO's example data is defined in ./example/ - see the ./examples/README.md for more information on how to update those datasets

## Development

Dependenices:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Go 1.22](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) for environment management
- [earthly](https://earthly.dev/get-earthly) for container builds
- [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/) for python package management

### Quickstart

Here are the essential commands to get started

```shell
# see help commands
make help

# ensure environment variables are set
direnv allow

# install dev tools
make install-dev-tools

# reset and start services in docker (postgres, clickhouse, ...)
make reset-services

# start the server with live reload (defaults to port 9090)
make run/live

# tests
make test

# run tests with live reload
make test/live

# database migration
go run ./cmd/dbtool/dbtool.go --help
```

### Typical Development Workflow

For local development, DAO requires the following services to be running:

- A postgres database (for dao's internal data)
- A clickhouse database (as the default database for assets + event data)

Dependencies can be started locally using docker compose:

```sh
# spin up dependencies
make start-services

# or, remove all existing data and restart from scratch
make reset-services
```

Then, the dao server can be started with live reload:

```sh
make run/live
```

Tests can be run with:

```sh
make test

# or with live reload
make test/live
```

### About the Local Setup

`make start-services` and `make reset-services` will start a dao container with only postgres and clickhouse exposed to the host machine. Then, the dao server can be started separately with `make run/live`. This is useful for development, so that the dao server can be rebuilt easily, independent of the databases.

### Deployment Modes

The dao docker image can be run in two deployment modes:

- local mode (default): a complete dao instance with a dao server, postgres and clickhouse. This is useful for local usage and development, but not for production.
- server-only mode: a dao server without postgres or clickhouse. This is used for production deployments where postgres and clickhouse are running elsewhere. This can be started with the `--server-only` flag:

```sh
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -it -p 9090:9090 -v dao-data:/data --name dao viaductai/dao:latest --server-only
```
