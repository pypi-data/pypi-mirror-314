            Note that the repository [README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
            file and [community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)
            are only recognized by GitHub when placed at certain paths, as follows:

            
            [README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
              file must be named `README` (case-sensitive) and placed either in the
              `.github` directory, the `docs` directory, or the root of the repository,
              and can have the extensions `.txt`, `.md`, or `.rst` (case-insensitive).
              If more than one of such files are present, the order of precedence is
              `.github`, then root, and finally the `docs` directory.
