# Blue Yonder
Bluesky Python API for humans.
```Bash
  pip install blue-yonder
```
Note: the pip package name has a dash `-` between the words.

Then:
```Python
# Python

from blue_yonder import Client
```
Note: the library name has an underscore `_` between the words.
<br>There are more 'playful' aliases for the `blue_yonder` Client too, namely:
```Python
from blue_yonder import Butterfly
# or
from blue_yonder import Bird
```
This is because Butterflies and Birds are the main 'clients' of the blue sky of course.

## Usage Examples
I didn't want to overload this repository and library with examples; you can use the Template repository with multiple examples, that I consider to be useful. It is located [here](https://github.com/alxfed/butterfly). Just click the 'Use this template' button at the top of the page and create your own repository in your account that you can edit and use the way you deem fit.
