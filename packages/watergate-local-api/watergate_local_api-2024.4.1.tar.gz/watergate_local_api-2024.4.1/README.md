# Watergate Local API Client

A robust Python client for interacting with the **Sonic Device Local API**. This client provides easy access to manage device settings, monitor telemetry data, and handle event webhooks from the device.

## Overview

The Watergate Local API Client simplifies interaction with the Sonic Device's local API, enabling developers to:
- Retrieve and update device state
- Access telemetry and networking data
- Configure auto shut-off settings and view reports
- Manage webhook configuration and receive real-time device events

## Features

- **Device State Management**: Access comprehensive device state details, including valve state, power supply, firmware version, and uptime.
- **Telemetry Access**: Retrieve telemetry data such as flow rate, pressure, and temperature.
- **Networking and Power Management**: Configure networking settings and monitor power supply status.
- **Event Webhook Support**: Handle and parse webhook events including auto-shut-off, telemetry, valve state changes, power supply changes, and WiFi updates.

## Installation

To install the Watergate Local API Client, clone the repository and install the package using `pip`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/watergate-ai/watergate-local-api-python.git
cd watergate-local-api-python
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to retrieve the device state and access telemetry data using the client.

```python
from watergate_local_api import WatergateLocalApiClient

async def main():
    async with WatergateLocalApiClient(base_url="http://testserver") as client:
        # Get device state
        device_state = await client.async_get_device_state()
        print("Valve State:", device_state.valve_state)

        # Access telemetry data
        telemetry_data = await client.async_get_telemetry_data()
        print("Flow Rate:", telemetry_data.flow)
```

### Webhook Event Parsing

You can parse incoming webhook events to handle device notifications, such as telemetry updates or auto-shut-off reports.

```python
from watergate_local_api.models import WebhookEvent

webhook_payload = {
    "type": "telemetry",
    "data": {
        "flow": 6800,
        "pressure": 2320,
        "temperature": 23.5,
        "event": {"volume": 16000, "duration": 90},
        "errors": ["flow"]
    }
}

# Parse webhook event
event = WebhookEvent.parse_webhook_event(webhook_payload)
print("Parsed Event:", event)
```
