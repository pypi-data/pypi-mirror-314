# Codexctl
A utility program that helps to manage the remarkable device version utilizing [ddvks update server](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-update) 

### Installation & Use

You can find pre-compiled binaries on the [releases](https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl/releases/) page. This includes a build for the reMarkable itself, as well as well as builds for linux, macOS, and Windows. It currently only has support for **command line interfaces** but a graphical interface is soon to come.

## Running from source

Codexctl can be run from source on both the reMarkable, as well as on a remote device.

### Running on reMarkable

```
git clone https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl.git
cd codexctl
pip install -r requirements.txt
python codexctl.py --help
```

### Running on a remote device

This requires python 3.11 or newer.

```
git clone https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl.git
cd codexctl
pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.remote.txt
python codexctl.py --help
```

## Building executables from source

This requires python 3.11 or newer, python-venv, pip. Linux also requires libfuse-dev.

```
make executable
```

The script is designed to have as little interactivity as possible, meaning arguments are directly taken from the command to run the script.
