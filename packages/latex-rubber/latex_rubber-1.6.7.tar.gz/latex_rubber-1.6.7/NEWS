  Fix two severe regressions in the python3 port.

    Patch from Matthias Goldhoorn <matthias@goldhoorn.eu>.

Version 1.4 (2015-12-11)

  This version of Rubber officially requires Python 2.6 and up.
  Note that the code has not been tested with Python 3, so if you
  run it under Python 3, you're on your own.  Bug reports are welcome!

  Starting with 1.4, the primary repository at Launchpad is a
  Git tree.

  Features:
  - New distutils-based build & install scripts by Nicolas.
  - Report BibTeX / Biber errors more reliably.
  - We have support for embedding R code via knitr.
    http://yihui.name/knitr/
    Closes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/1422759
    Note that since R can run arbitrary external code, --unsafe
    must be given at the command line:
      rubber -d --unsafe paper.Rtex
    creates beautifully typeset PDF from your R script.
  - Support for PythonTeX package.  Also requires --unsafe if
    you want Rubber to invoke pythontex.
  - Rubber will no longer attempt to use jpeg2ps on its own, which has
    been superseded by sam2p.  (You can add it back by providing your
    own rules.ini.)

  Bugfixes:
  - Refuse to read logfiles which exceed 1 MB.
    This avoids out-of-memory situations.  The limit may be raised with
      % rubber: set logfile_limit 1000000
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/628150
  - The command-line parsing of rubber and rubber-info has been merged.
    Thus, the --inplace and --into options are not only accepted by
    Rubber (as they were previously), they also take effect.
    Closes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/975376
  - Rubber complains properly now for nonexisting directives, and
    doesn't just print a stacktrace.
    Closes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/1090115
  - More refactoring, reducing the number of code paths to test and
    maintain.

Version 1.3 (2015-10-11)

  This version of rubber has changes in the dependency management.
  As a result, it may call LaTeX more often than it used to.
  On the other hand, there are less corner cases when LaTeX or
  BibTeX should have been called, but wasn't.

  Thanks to Nicolas Boulenguez for helping with lots of patches.

  Features:
    - Rewriting dependency management code with the aims of
      simplicity, correctness and reduced lines of code.
    - Support for SyncTeX.
      You can enable SyncTeX support by calling rubber --synctex,
      or by having a magic line
        % rubber: synctex
      in your document's preamble.
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/414431
    - Support for ltxtable, glossaries and biblatex, contributed
      by Sebastian Reichel.  Please test and report any problems!
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/860661
    - Support for asymptote, contributed by Nicolas Boulenguez.
    - Support for bibtopic, contributed by Nicolas Boulenguez.
      https://bugs.debian.org/460670
    - The BibTeX support can now use a different version of BibTeX.
      The external command for Rubber to run goes into the .tool variable:
      For example:
        % rubber: bibtex.tool bibtex8
      tells Rubber to use BibTeX8.
      https://bugs.debian.org/471185
    - New directive: "produce" which implies that a file is being
      generated during LaTeXing and must be cleaned up afterwards.
      Example:
        % rubber: produce doc.toc
      Indicates that during LaTeXing, .toc will be written (produce).
      Example 2:
        % rubber: produce doc.toc
        % rubber: watch doc.toc
      Indicates that doc.toc will be read (watch) and updated (produce).
      This also tells rubber to recompile the LaTeX document until
      doc.toc no longer changes.  "produce" implies "clean", i.e. the
      file will be disposed of when rubber is invoked with --clean.
    - Beginnings of a test suite.
      The current code does not pass all the tests (neither
      did previous Rubbers).

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix handling of absolute pathnames by not having absolute pathnames
      for the most part.
      https://bugs.debian.org/682892
      https://bugs.debian.org/798829
      https://bugs.debian.org/798991
    - Fix bibtex.path directive.
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/686187
      https://bugs.debian.org/694265
    - Fix ntheorem support.
      https://bugs.debian.org/328107
    - Fix TeX parser to handle spaces and comments between the macro
      and its arguments.
      More radical fix than Debian (https://bugs.debian.org/725355)
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/1049883
    - Fix read directive.  Patch by Lionel Vaux.
      https://bugs.debian.org/701898
    - Fix dvipdfm, backref and hyperref support.
    - Fix \includegraphics*
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/1478034
    - Fix elatex being called when etex.sty is use'd.
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/856449
    - Typos and clarifications in the docs, lots of cleanup and minor
      fixes in the code.

Version 1.2 (2015-06-25)

  Features:
    - shell_escape feature to enable -shell-escape in LaTeX.
      BEWARE: granting shell-escape (write18) to a document permits it
      to run arbitrary external commands.  Use only on trusted (your own)
      documents!
      Usage:  to mark a document as requiring shell-escape, add the line
            % rubber: shell_escape
      near the header.  To grant shell-escape to a document, run rubber as
            rubber --unsafe document.tex
      There are several older hacks documented on the internet which continue
      to work, but are deprecated from now on.  The 'arguments' variable
      will be removed in the future.
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/878629
    - XeLaTeX support.
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/660426
      https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=579757
    - Support for gnuplottex (requires --unsafe)
    - Experimental PythonTeX support contributed by Ferdinand Schwenk
      (requires --unsafe).

    - Fix BibTeX called with absolute path and refusing to write.
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/1287593
    - Fix LaTeX parsing with optional whitespace
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/195258
    - Fix behavior when .aux is not generated
