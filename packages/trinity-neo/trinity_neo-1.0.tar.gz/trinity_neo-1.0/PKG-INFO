## What is Trinity-Neo?
Trinity-Neo is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle exponentially and makes you more productive.

In comparison with the other open-source machine learning libraries, Trinity-Neo is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with few words only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. Trinity is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, pycaret, nltk, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and many more.
