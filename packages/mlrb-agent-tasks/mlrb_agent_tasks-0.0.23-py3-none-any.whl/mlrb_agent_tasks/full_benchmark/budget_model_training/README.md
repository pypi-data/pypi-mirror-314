# Budgeted Model Training

This challenge aims to build the best classifier for ImageNet100 within strict constraints. Participants cannot use pre-trained models or depend on external resources. The evaluation process includes multiple phases, with the final evaluation using a private ImageNet100 dataset. Hardware constraints include training on a P100 GPU with 4 CPU cores, a 9-hour time limit, and a 6GB GPU memory limit. The goal is to maximize accuracy while adhering to these resource constraints.

### Participation Requirements

* Goal: Build the best classifier for ImageNet100 within given constraints
* No use of pre-trained models
* Code should not depend on external pre-trained models or internet access
* Submit Python scripts and a .yaml file for the run environment
* Main script file should be named main.py and take one command line argument â€”data_dir
* Output a submission.csv in the current working directory

### Dataset

* ImageNet100 (100 classes subset of ImageNet)
* Final evaluation will use a different set of 100 classes than those revealed initially

### Evaluation Process

* Standard classification problem
* Maximize accuracy on the test set
* Leaderboard ranking based on accuracy

### Scoring

* Train on private ImageNet100 dataset
* Score on corresponding test set determines model performance

### Hardware Constraints

* Training on A100 GPU with 4 CPU cores
* Maximum 9 hours of training time
* GPU memory consumption should not exceed 6 GB at any point
* Final evaluation machine configuration:
* GPU: A100 80GB GPU
* GPU Memory Limit: 6GB
* Total Time Limit: 9 Hours
* CPU Cores: 4
* RAM: 32GB

### Time Constraints
* 24 Hour Time Limit
