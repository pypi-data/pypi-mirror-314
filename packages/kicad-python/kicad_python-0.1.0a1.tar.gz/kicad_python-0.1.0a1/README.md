# KiCad API Python Bindings

`kicad-python` is the official Python bindings for the [KiCad](https://kicad.org) IPC API.  This
library makes it possible to develop scripts and tools that interact with a running KiCad session.

For more information about the IPC API, please see the [KiCad developer documentation](https://dev-docs.kicad.org).

Note: Version 0.0.2 and prior of this package are an obsolete earlier effort and are unrelated to
this codebase.

## Contributing

At the moment, these bindings are being developed in parallel with the IPC API itself, and
development is being coordinated by the KiCad team (main point of contact: Jon Evans / @craftyjon).
Expect rapid change and instability during this development period, and please do not send merge
requests without discussing your idea for changes with the team ahead of time.

Once the initial stable API is released (planned for KiCad 9.0 in February 2025), this Python
library will also have its first stable release and be considered fully supported.  Until that
time, please consider this a development preview.

## Building

See COMPILING.md

## API Documentation

There is no documentation yet, sorry.  We expect things to be stable enough to begin documentation
for general use in late 2024.

## Examples

Check out the repository for some example scripts that may serve as a starting point.
