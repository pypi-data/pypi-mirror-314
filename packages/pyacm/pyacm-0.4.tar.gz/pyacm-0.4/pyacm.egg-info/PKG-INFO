# pyacm
Implementation of ["Pricing the Term Structure with Linear Regressions" from 
Adrian, Crump and Moench (2013)][paper_website].

The `NominalACM` class prices the time series and cross-section of the term 
structure of interest rates using a three-step linear regression approach.
Computations are fast, even with a large number of pricing factors. The object 
carries all the relevant variables as atributes:
- The yield curve itself
- The excess returns from the synthetic zero coupon bonds
- The principal components of the curve used as princing factors
- Risk premium parameter estimates
- Yields fitted by the model
- Risk-neutral yields
- Term premium
- Historical in-sample expected returns 
- Expected return loadings
- Hypothesis testing (Not sure if correct, more info observations below)


# Instalation
```bash
pip install pyacm
```

# Usage
```python
from pyacm import NominalACM

acm = NominalACM(
    curve=yield_curve,
    n_factors=5,
)
```
The tricky part of using this model is getting the correct data format. The 
`yield_curve` dataframe in the expression above requires:
- Annualized log-yields for zero-coupon bonds
- Observations (index) must be in either monthly or daily frequency
- Maturities (columns) must be equally spaced in **monthly** frequency and start 
at month 1. This means that you need to construct a bootstraped curve for every 
date and interpolate it at fixed monthly maturities
- Whichever maturity you want to be the longest, your input data should have one
column more. For example, if you want term premium estimate up to the 10-year 
yield (120 months), your input data should include maturities up to 121 months. 
This is needed to properly compute the returns.

# Examples

The estimates for the US are available on the [NY FED website](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/data_indicators/term-premia-tabs#/overview).

The jupyter notebook [`example_br`](https://github.com/gusamarante/pyacm/blob/main/example_br.ipynb) 
contains an example application to the Brazilian DI futures curve that showcases all the available methods.

The version of the article that was published by the NY FED is not 100% explicit on how the data is being manipulated, 
but I found an earlier version of the paper on SSRN where the authors go deeper into the details on how everything is being estimated:
- Data for zero yields uses monthly maturities starting from month 1
- All principal components and model parameters are estiamted with data resampled to a monthly frequency, averaging observations in each month
- To get daily / real-time estimates, the factor loadings estimated from the monthly frquency are used to transform the daily data


# Observations
I am not completely sure that computations in the [inferences attributes][inference_atribute] 
are correct. If you find any mistakes, please open a pull request following the contributing
