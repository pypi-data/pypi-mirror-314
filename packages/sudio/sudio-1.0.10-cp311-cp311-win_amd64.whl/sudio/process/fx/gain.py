        Initialize the Gain audio effect processor.

        Configures gain processing with streaming and offline capabilities,
        optimized for 32-bit floating-point audio processing.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        *args : Variable positional arguments
            Arguments for parent FX class initialization.

        **kwargs : Variable keyword arguments
            Additional configuration parameters.

        """
        Apply dynamic gain adjustment to audio signals with soft clipping.

        Modify audio amplitude using decibel-based gain control, featuring built-in
        soft clipping to prevent harsh distortion and maintain signal integrity.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        data : numpy.ndarray
            Input audio data to be gain-processed. Supports single and multi-channel inputs.

        gain_db : float or int, optional
            Gain adjustment in decibels:
            - 0.0 (default): No volume change
            - Negative values: Reduce volume
            - Positive values: Increase volume

        Additional keyword arguments are ignored in this implementation.

        Returns:
        --------
        numpy.ndarray
            Gain-adjusted audio data with preserved dynamic range and minimal distortions

        Examples:
        ---------
            >>> from sudio.process.fx import Gain
            >>> su = sudio.Master()
