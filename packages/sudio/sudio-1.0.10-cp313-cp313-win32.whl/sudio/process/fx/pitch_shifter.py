        Perform pitch shifting on the input audio data.

        This method allows pitch modification through multiple parametrization approaches:
        1. Semitone and cent-based pitch shifting
        2. Direct ratio-based pitch shifting
        3. Envelope-based dynamic pitch shifting

        Parameters:
        -----------
        data : np.ndarray
            Input audio data as a NumPy array. Supports mono and multi-channel audio.
            Recommended data type is float32.

        semitones : np.float32, optional
            Number of semitones to shift the pitch. 
            Positive values increase pitch, negative values decrease pitch.
            Default is 0.0 (no change).
            
            Example:
            - 12.0 shifts up one octave
            - -12.0 shifts down one octave

        cent : np.float32, optional
            Fine-tuning pitch adjustment in cents (1/100th of a semitone).
            Allows precise micro-tuning between semitones.
            Default is 0.0.

            Example:
            - 50.0 shifts up half a semitone
            - -25.0 shifts down a quarter semitone

        ratio : np.float32, optional
            Direct pitch ratio modifier. 
            - 1.0 means no change
            - > 1.0 increases pitch
            - < 1.0 decreases pitch
            Default is 1.0.

            Note: When semitones or cents are used, this ratio is multiplicative.

        envelope : np.ndarray, optional
            Dynamic pitch envelope for time-varying pitch shifting.
            If provided, allows non-uniform pitch modifications across the audio.
            Default is an empty list (uniform pitch shifting).

            Example:
            - A varying array of ratios can create complex pitch modulations

        **kwargs : dict
            Additional keyword arguments passed to the underlying pitch shifting algorithm.
            Allows fine-tuning of advanced parameters like:
            - sample_rate: Audio sample rate
            - frame_length: Processing frame size
            - converter_type: Resampling algorithm

        Returns:
        --------
        np.ndarray
            Pitch-shifted audio data with the same number of channels as input.

        Examples:
        ---------
        >>> record = record.afx(PitchShifter, start=30, envelope=[1, 3, 1, 1]) # Dynamic pitch shift
        >>> record = record.afx(PitchShifter, semitones=4)  # Shift up 4 semitones
        
        Notes:
        ------
        - Uses high-quality time-domain pitch shifting algorithm
        - Preserves audio quality with minimal artifacts
        - Supports both uniform and dynamic pitch modifications
