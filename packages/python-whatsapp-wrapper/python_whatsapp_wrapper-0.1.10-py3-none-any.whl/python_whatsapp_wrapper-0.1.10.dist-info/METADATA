üìñ Introduction
---------------

A high-level Python wrapper for the WhatsApp API, providing easy abstraction.

A huge thanks to `Python-Telegram-Bot`_ team for their impressive work on Telegram bots, which inspired me to create this wrapper.

üì± Whatsapp API Supports
------------------------

Tested in version ``v19.0``, but you can try older versions by changing ``api_version`` in ``whatsapp.bot.WhatsappBot.api_version``.

üõ†Ô∏è Before start
---------------

Before you can create your own bots, you need to follow some steps to become a `Meta API Developer`_.

**YOU NEED**  to become a Meta developer to use their API. You can find the step-by-step guide here: `Facebook Developers WhatsApp API`_

.. warning::
    It's preferable to have an extra/new SIM card to register your business account (don't try with your personal SIM, this action will **ERASE** all your whatsapp data), but they give you some free credits to get started.

üöÄ Installation
---------------

We're on PyPI! So you can easy install using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install python-whatsapp-wrapper

Or directly by cloning project's GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Sergio-Daniel-Pires/python-whatsapp-wrapper
    cd python-whatsapp-wrapper
    pip install .

ü§î How I made my own bot?
-------------------------

Our repository contains many examples that you can just click-and-run.
You might want to try ``echo_bot.py``, a bot that returns any text you send it.
