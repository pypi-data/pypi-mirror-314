inincompatibility
=================

A ``socket``-based solution for resolving **Python** environment
incompatibilities.

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Installation**:

To install the ``inincompatibility`` package, run:

.. code:: shell

   pip install inincompatibility

**Example: LLMs Integration**:

First, make your LLMs callable functions and ``import`` them into a
``.py`` file, like so:

.. code:: python

   # LLM_functions.py
   from your_LLM import your_forward, your_backward

Next, use the ``inincompatibility`` package to run the LLM in its
(**Python** / **conda**) environment and generate the necessary
importable code:

.. code:: shell

   python -m inincompatibility -i LLM_functions.py -o api_for_other.py

Now, you can directly ``import`` the generated code in another
(**Python** / **conda**) environment:

.. code:: python

   # your_other_code.py
   from api_for_other import your_forward, your_backward
