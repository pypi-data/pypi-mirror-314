# 🎯 Screenium

Screenium is like Selenium after discovering there's a whole world outside the browser. Find and click any text on your screen using OCR. That "Accept Cookies" popup for the millionth time? Banish it.

## 🔍 Installation

```bash
pip install screenium
```

or

```bash
uv add screenium
```


## ✨ Use Cases

- **Auto-Accept Cookies**: Run a background task that automatically clicks "Accept Cookies" popups
- **Meeting Assistant**: Auto-join video calls by detecting "Join Meeting" buttons and automatically enable/disable your camera/mic based on meeting names
- **Game Automation**: Automate repetitive game tasks by detecting and clicking on in-game text (e.g., "Collect Rewards", "Start Battle")
- **System Dialog Monitor**: Handling system or application dialogs, like "Are you sure?" or "Run command," in Cursor based on set rules.
- **Multi-Browser Testing**: Perform UI tests on browsers that lack automation APIs or web drivers with no separate web driver installations needed.

## 🔍 Finding Text

The most basic way to find text is:

```python
from screenium import Text

# Simple text matching
text = Text("Login")  # Finds "Login" anywhere on screen
text = Text("LOG")    # Matches the first of "LOGIN", "LOGOUT", etc.

# Exact matching
text = Text("Login", exact_match=True)  # Only matches "Login" exactly
text = Text("login", case_sensitive=True)  # Case-sensitive matching
```

## 📍 Spatial Relationships

You can find text based on its position relative to other text:

```python
# Basic relationships
Text("Password").below("Username")  # Find "Password" below "Username"
Text("Cancel").left_of("Submit")    # Find "Cancel" left of "Submit"
Text("Help").right_of("Back")       # Find "Help" right of "Back"
Text("Title").above("Content")      # Find "Title" above "Content"

# Chain relationships
Text("Save").below("Options").right_of("Cancel")
```

### 📐 Aligned Elements

For more precise positioning, use `aligned` to require elements to line up:

```python
# Elements must be vertically aligned (same x-axis)
Text("Email").aligned.below("Username")

# Elements must be horizontally aligned (same y-axis)
Text("Back").aligned.left_of("Next")
```

## 🎨 Background Color Matching

Find text by its background color:

```python
# Match text with specific background colors
Text("Error", background_color="red")
Text("Success", background_color="green")
Text("Info", background_color="#0088ff")

# Adjust color matching tolerance (0-100)
Text("Warning", background_color="yellow", background_tolerance=50)
```

## 🖱️ Mouse Actions

Interact with matched text:

```python
# Basic mouse actions
Text("Submit").click()
Text("Options").right_click()
Text("Link").double_click()
Text("Button").mouse_move()  # Just move mouse without clicking

# Type text
Text("Username").click().typewrite("myuser")
Text("Password").click().typewrite("mypass")

# Special keys
Text("Terminal").click().typewrite(["command", "k"])  # Clear terminal
```

## ⏰ Waiting and Monitoring

Handle timing and background monitoring:

```python
# Wait for specific duration
Text("Loading").wait(2).click()  # Wait 2 seconds then click
```

## 🔍 Inspecting Matches

Get detailed information about matches:

```python
# Get all matches
matches = Text("Button").matches
for match in matches:
    print(f"Found at: ({match['x']}, {match['y']})")
    print(f"Size: {match['width']}x{match['height']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {match['confidence']}")
```

## 🎨 Visual Debugging

Draw boxes around matches to debug:

```python
# Draw green box for 3 seconds
Text("Username").draw(duration=3, color="green")

# Chain with other operations
Text("Password").below("Username").draw(duration=2, color="red").click()
```

## 🎯 Tips & Best Practices

1. Start with basic text matching before adding spatial relationships
2. Use `draw()` to visually verify matches
3. Adjust background color tolerance if color matching is too strict/loose
4. Use `aligned` when elements should line up precisely
5. Chain operations for more precise matching

## ⚠️ Limitations

- macOS only (uses Apple Vision framework)
- Requires macOS Monterey (12.x) or higher
- Screen resolution and scaling can affect matching

## 🔐 Required macOS Permissions

Screenium needs two key macOS permissions to function. The app running your Python script (e.g., Terminal, VS Code, PyCharm) will need:

1. **Screen Recording**
   - Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording
   - Toggle on your terminal app/IDE
   - Required for:
     - Finding text on screen using OCR
     - Background monitoring
     - Visual debugging with `draw()`

2. **Accessibility**
   - Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
   - Toggle on your terminal app/IDE
   - Required for:
     - Mouse actions (`click()`, `right_click()`, etc.)
     - Keyboard input (`typewrite()`, `hotkey()`)

> 💡 **Tip**: If running from different apps, each one needs separate permissions. For example, if you run scripts from both Terminal and VS Code, you'll need to grant permissions to both.
