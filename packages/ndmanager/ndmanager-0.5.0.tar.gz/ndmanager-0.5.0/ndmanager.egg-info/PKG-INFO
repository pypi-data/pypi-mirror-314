NDManager is a python package that helps you manage your nuclear data
files in a clean manner.

It provides an API and a CLI for creating and interacting with a
database of ENDF6 files, as well as processed data files and depletion
chain files in the OpenMC format.

In addition, it encapsulate the
[sandy](https://github.com/luca-fiorito-11/sandy) nuclear data sampling
tool to help you easily generate perturbed files in the OpenMC HDF5
format.
