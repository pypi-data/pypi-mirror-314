This module restores the permissions requisites for Point of Sale users
to perform cash operations in their sessions.

Use Cases / Context
===================

From `this change <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/130275>`__ a Point
of Sale user who needs to perform cash control operations
*Accounting/Billing* permission is required. That's a huge permission
for the kind of user that only does cashing machine operations.

We're recovering the former behavior present in previous versions.

Usage
=====

After this module is installed:

1. Choose a user with *Point of Sale/User* permissions but no
   *Accounting/Billing* permission.
2. Open a session in a Point of Sale with cash control active.
3. You'll be able to do any of the cash control operations (cash in /
   out).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- This module will be unnecessary if
  https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/188798 gets merged or the former
  permissions paradigm is restored in any other way.
