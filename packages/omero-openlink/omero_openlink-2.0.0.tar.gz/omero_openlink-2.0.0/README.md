# OMERO.openlink  <img src="/images/icon.png?raw=true" width="70" height="70">   

An OMERO.web plugin that creates openly accessible links (URLS for raw files) to your data in OMERO and a batch file to download the data with 'curl'.


## Main application:
* Make internal data for a publication available to reviewers in advance via a URL
* Bundle data of different groups/projects/datasets together
* Fast download of large data
* Enable external collaborators to easily access selected data via URL


## Example: 
**Provide data used in a publication**

#### OMERO.openlink is composed of two components:

***Create_OpenLink.py*** (generation)
A server side script that generates soft links to your data and creates a **curl** file for batch download of this data.
You can share only your own data or the data of a non-private group if you are the owner of this group (the owner of the data will be informed by mail).

NOTE:
If you prefer another download manager, you can change the generated commands in the Python script.

***omero-openlink*** (visualization)
An OMERO.web plugin that lists the links to generated areas of softlinks via the nginx server. Provides the corresponding **curl** command to start the download in a shell. With the plugin the areas can also be deleted via OMERO.web.
