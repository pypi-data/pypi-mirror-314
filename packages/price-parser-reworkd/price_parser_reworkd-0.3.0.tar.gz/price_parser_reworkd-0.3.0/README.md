# Price Parser Reworkd

`Price Parser` is a Python library created by reworkd team that provides Pydantic-compatible data types for parsing and extracting price-related information from strings. It allows you to effortlessly handle numeric values, currency symbols, and currency names in a structured and validated way using Pydantic models.

## Features

- Extract numeric price values from strings.
- Support for more than 60 currencies
- Detect currency symbols and convert them into readable currency names.
- Built on **Pydantic** for easy integration with modern Python projects.
- Lightweight and production-ready.
- Can handle price unavailable phrases

## Usage

### ParserTypeCurrency

Extract both the numeric price value and the currency details (symbol and name).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from price_parser import ParserTypeCurrency

class PriceModel(BaseModel):
    price: ParserTypeCurrency

# Example 1: Valid input with currency symbol
price_info = PriceModel(price="$19.99")
print(price_info.price)
# Output: {'currency': 'USD', 'currency_symbol': '$', 'amount': 19.99}

# Example 2: Valid input without a currency
price_info = PriceModel(price=1500.75)
print(price_info.price)
# Output: {'currency': None, 'currency_symbol': None, 'amount': 1500.75}

# Example 3: String with known currency name
price_info = PriceModel(price="EUR 49.99")
print(price_info.price)
# Output: {'currency': 'EUR', 'currency_symbol': '€', 'amount': 49.99}

```

---

## Example Use Cases

### Full Price Details

Extract both the price value and currency details:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from price_parser import ParserTypeCurrency

class CombinedModel(BaseModel):
    full_price_details_USD: ParserTypeCurrency
    full_price_details_EUR: ParserTypeCurrency

# Input data
data = {
    "full_price_details_USD": "USD 19.99",
    "full_price_details_EUR": "€1.234",
}

# Parse the data
price_info = CombinedModel(**data)
print(price_info.full_price_details_USD)   # Output: {'currency': 'USD', 'currency_symbol': '$', 'amount': 19.99}
print(price_info.full_price_details_EUR)  # Output: {'currency': 'EUR', 'currency_symbol': '€', 'amount': 1234.0}
```

### E-Commerce Data Processing

Ideal for processing pricing data from product listings.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from price_parser import ParserTypeCurrency


class ProductModel(BaseModel):
    price: ParserTypeCurrency

def parse_and_display_products(products):
    """
    Parses a list of product prices using a Pydantic model and displays the extracted information.

    Args:
        products (list): A list of price strings to be parsed.
    """
    for product in products:
        try:
            product_data = ProductModel(price=product)
            info = product_data.price
            print(
                f"Price: {info['amount']}, Currency: {info['currency']}, Symbol: {info['currency_symbol']}"
            )
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Error parsing product price '{product}': {e}")


products = ["$19.99", "€15.50", "₹1200"]
parse_and_display_products(products)
```
