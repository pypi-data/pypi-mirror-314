           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Argus API Client
[![test badge](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/Uninett/pyargus/tox.yml?branch=master)](https://github.com/Uninett/pyargus/actions)
[![Ruff](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/ruff/main/assets/badge/v2.json)](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

This is the official Python client library for the 
[Argus](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus) API server.

The Argus server is an incident registry, capable of aggregating alerts from 
multiple source systems. Argus also can send event notifications (via e-mail,
SMS, etc.) when incidents are created or resolved.

## Usage examples

The pyargus library models [the official API endoints of
Argus](https://argus-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) as methods on an
API client object.

At the moment, only the methods and models needed to interact with
incident-related endpoints are supported.

The `Client` class is found in `pyargus.client`, and the various supported data
models, such as `Incident`, `Event`, `Acknowledgement` and `SourceSystem`, are
implemented in `pyargus.models`.

### Listing open incidents that have not been acknowledged

```pycon
>>> from pyargus.client import Client
>>> c = Client(api_root_url="https://argus.example.org/api/v2", token="foobar")
>>> for incident in c.get_incidents(open=True, acked=False):
...    print(incident)
...
Incident(pk=4, start_time=datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 4, 16, 37, 43, 293726, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200), '+02:00')), end_time=datetime.datetime(9999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, 999999), source=SourceSystem(pk=2, name='testnav', type='nav', user=3, base_url='http://localhost/'), source_incident_id='202430', details_url='http://localhost/search/event/202430', description='uninett-gsw2 BGP session with 158.38.3.112 is DOWN', level=5, ticket_url='', tags={'location': 'Teknobyen Innovasjonssenter', 'kundetjeneste': 'Nett_CNaaS', 'kunde': 'example.org', 'event_type': 'bgpState', 'alert_type': 'bgpDown', 'room': '100', 'organization': 'uninett.srv', 'host': 'uninett-gsw2.uninett.no'}, stateful=True, open=True, acked=False)
Incident(pk=3, start_time=datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 4, 16, 32, 53, 128780, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200), '+02:00')), end_time=datetime.datetime(9999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, 999999), source=SourceSystem(pk=2, name='testnav', type='nav', user=3, base_url='http://localhost/'), source_incident_id='202429', details_url='http://localhost/search/event/202429', description='uninett-gsw1 BGP session with 158.38.3.112 is DOWN', level=5, ticket_url='', tags={'location': 'Teknobyen Innovasjonssenter', 'kundetjeneste': 'Nett_CNaaS', 'kunde': 'example.org', 'event_type': 'bgpState', 'alert_type': 'bgpDown', 'host': 'uninett-gsw1.uninett.no', 'room': '100', 'organization': 'uninett.srv'}, stateful=True, open=True, acked=False)
Incident(pk=2, start_time=datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 31, 14, 58, 31, 118794, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200), '+02:00')), end_time=datetime.datetime(9999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, 999999), source=SourceSystem(pk=2, name='testnav', type='nav', user=3, base_url='http://localhost/'), source_incident_id='184296', details_url='http://localhost/search/event/184296', description='Link DOWN on Gi0/3 at oldsmobile.lab (Simple is better than complex)', level=5, ticket_url='', tags={'room': '113', 'location': 'Teknobyen Innovasjonssenter', 'organization': 'uninett.testlab', 'kundetjeneste': 'Nett_CNaaS', 'kunde': 'example.org', 'event_type': 'linkState', 'alert_type': 'linkDown', 'host': 'oldsmobile.lab.uninett.no', 'interface': 'Gi0/3'}, stateful=True, open=True, acked=False)
```

As you can see, the arguments given to `get_incidents()` are translated
verbatim into the arguments supported by the `/incidents` endpoint in the API.

### List only "my" incidents

The incidents API also has an `/incidents/mine` endpoint, which works just like
the `/incidents` endpoint, but searches only the incidents that were posted
by the connecting user. This is useful for glue services, when they need to
compare the list of open Argus incidents it has produced with the current list
of active alerts in its source system.

Example:

```pycon
>>> from pyargus.client import Client
>>> c = Client(api_root_url="https://argus.example.org/api/v2", token="foobar")
>>> for incident in c.get_my_incidents(open=True, acked=False):
...    print(incident)
...
Incident(pk=3, start_time=datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 4, 16, 32, 53, 128780, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200), '+02:00')), end_time=datetime.datetime(9999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, 999999), source=SourceSystem(pk=3, name='foobar, type='nav', user=4, base_url='http://localhost/'), source_incident_id='2716057', details_url='http://localhost/search/event/2716057', description='uninett-gsw1 BGP session with 158.38.3.112 is DOWN', level=5, ticket_url='', tags={'location': 'Teknobyen Innovasjonssenter', 'kundetjeneste': 'Nett_CNaaS', 'kunde': 'example.org', 'event_type': 'bgpState', 'alert_type': 'bgpDown', 'host': 'uninett-gsw1.uninett.no', 'room': '100', 'organization': 'uninett.srv'}, stateful=True, open=True, acked=False)
```

### Post a new incident

```pycon
>>> from pyargus.client import Client
>>> from pyargus.models import Incident
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> c = Client(api_root_url="https://argus.example.org/api/v2", token="foobar")
>>> i = Incident(
...     description="The earth was demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass", 
...     start_time=datetime.now(),
...     tags={
...         "host": "earth.example.org",
...     }
... )
>>> c.post_incident(i)
Incident(pk=8, start_time=datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 22, 11, 41, 53, 580947, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200), '+02:00')), end_time=None, source=SourceSystem(pk=2, name='testnav', type='nav', user=3, base_url='http://localhost/'), source_incident_id='', details_url='', description='The earth was demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass', level=5, ticket_url='', tags={'host': 'earth.example.org'}, stateful=False, open=False, acked=False)
```

The `post_incident()` method returns the full `Incident` record, as stored in
Argus. If you need it, you can get the incident ID from the the primary key
attribute `pk`, in case you need to address it directly later.

### Close an existing incident

Incidents are closed by posting a *END* type event to an incident's event
log, with an optional timestamp. The `Client` class provides the follow
convenience method for this operation:

```pycon
>>> from pyargus.client import Client
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> c = Client(api_root_url="https://argus.example.org/api/v2", token="foobar")
>>> c.resolve_incident(incident=8, description="The demolition was cancelled", timestamp=datetime.now())
Event(pk=10, actor='testnav', description='The demolition was cancelled', incident=8, received=datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 22, 11, 47, 11, 978438, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200), '+02:00')), timestamp=datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 22, 11, 47, 11, 946076, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200), '+02:00')), type='END')
```

### Modify an existing incident

Argus does not allow modification of most incident attributes, but things
like the tag list can be changed. Modifications are made by constructing an
`Incident` object with the `pk` attribute set to the id of the incident you
wish you modify, and then adding values to the attributes you wish to modify:

```pycon
>>> from pyargus.client import Client
>>> from pyargus.models import Incident
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> c = Client(api_root_url="https://argus.example.org/api/v2", token="foobar")
>>> i = Incident(
...     pk=8,
...     tags={
...         "host": "earth.example.org",
...         "location": "Milky way",
...     }
... )
>>> c.update_incident(i)
Incident(pk=8, start_time=datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 22, 11, 41, 53, 580947, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200), '+02:00')), end_time=None, source=SourceSystem(pk=2, name='testnav', type='nav', user=3, base_url='http://localhost/'), source_incident_id='', details_url='', description='The earth was demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass', level=None, ticket_url='', tags={'host': 'earth.example.org', 'location': 'Milky way'}, stateful=False, open=False, acked=False)

```

### Stateless incidents

Argus supports a concept of "stateless" incidents. Stateless incidents
represent single points in time, and do not have an end time. To explicitly
create stateless incidents, set the `end_time` attribute to the STATELESS
sentinel, like so:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from pyargus.models import Incident, STATELESS

stateless_incident = Incident(
    description="Something happened",
    start_time=datetime.now(),
    end_time=STATELESS
)
```


### Get a new authentication token

If your argus server is running version 1.29.0 or newer you can request to get
a new token (with a new expiration date) via API version 2. The token you are
using to access the server with must still be valid.

## Development

### Code style

Pyargus uses *ruff* as a source code formatter. Ruff is part of the optional dev dependencies listed in
[pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml)

A pre-commit hook will format new code automatically before committing.
To enable this pre-commit hook, run

```console
$ pre-commit install
```
