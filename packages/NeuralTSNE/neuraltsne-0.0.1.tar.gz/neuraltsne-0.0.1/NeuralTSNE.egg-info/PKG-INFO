# NeuralTSNE

NeuralTSNE is a parametric t-SNE implementation that uses neural networks to learn the mapping from high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional space. It uses PyTorch for the neural network implementation and can be run on a GPU for faster computations. It also emloys Lightning library, which serves as a high-level wrapper for PyTorch, to simplify the training process. The package can be imported as Python module or used as a command-line tool.

## Features

- Neural t-SNE implementation
- CUDA support for faster computations
- Integration with PyTorch
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation generated with Sphinx

## Installation

To install the package, run:


```sh
pip install NeuralTSNE
```

## Usage

Example usage was provided in the [examples](../examples/) directory.
