## What is VividNode? ü§î

**VividNode** is a cross-platform desktop application that allows you to interact directly with LLM(GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama) chatbots and generate images without needing a browser. Built with PySide6, VividNode (formerly known as pyqt-openai) supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, and securely stores your chat history locally in a database.

### Key Features:
- **Chat Interface**: Enjoy a seamless chat experience with a customizable interface, fast thread and message search, and advanced conversation settings. You can also import/export chat histories and use prompt management tools for efficient prompt engineering.
- **Image Generation**: Generate images using OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E 3 or models from Replicate or GPT4Free, directly within your chat sessions. The app supports endless image generation, randomly generated prompt, automatic saving, and integrated image management.
- **Focus and Accessibility Modes**: Utilize Focus Mode, ‚ÄúAlways on Top‚Äù Mode, transparency adjustments, and background notifications to keep the chat accessible and responsive without overwhelming system resources.
- **Customization and Shortcuts**: VividNode offers extensive customization options, including language settings, memory management, and a comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts for faster operations.
- **Support for interactive chatting (STT & TTS)**: It features a recording function using OpenAI's STT capabilities and allows responses to be heard in various voices through OpenAI Whisper or the TTS functionality of the Edge browser (using edge-tts, which is free).

With VividNode, you can experience a more powerful and resource-efficient alternative to browser-based GPT interfaces, making it easier to manage both text and image-based interactions.

## Sidenote üóíÔ∏è
Although this is named 'pyqt-openai', the model does not use only OpenAI-related models, and the GUI is created using PySide6, not PyQt. 'pyqt-openai' was the package name decided initially, and we are still using it as changing the package name now would likely result in a huge disaster.

## How to Install

## Test Scenario
This is the [default test scenario page](https://github.com/yjg30737/pyqt-openai/wiki/Test-Scenario). If you want to test it out and be sure nothing is wrong, try it :)

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
#### Issues Related to PyAudio
- This issue is often due to the absence of PortAudio. Make sure to install PortAudio before you install PyAudio.
#### Issues Related to PySide6 During Installation 
- As of October 14, 2024, PySide6 supports Python versions above 3.9 and below 3.13. If support for Python 3.13 is added in the future, you can remove this note.
#### Handling Error Messages Related to Software Updates (Windows)
- If you encounter the following error message when trying to update VividNode via the auto-update feature: **PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied**, To resolve this issue, run VividNode as an administrator.
- Also, if VividNode keeps asking "Wanna update?" even though you've updated it already, just install this again and everything will be fine.
#### Runtime error
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f53b44bb-1572-48ce-a9a0-a5da2b338d09)
- If you see the error above, run the application again. It is likely to be shown in old version(below v1.5.0) so update to the latest version.
 
#### Incomplete or Inaccurate Translations
- If you come across incomplete or unnatural translations, please update the **pyqt_openai/lang/translations.json** file.
