# Mailos

Mailos is a Python package that transforms any email inbox into an intelligent agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It monitors email accounts and can automatically respond to incoming messages using various AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and AWS Bedrock.

## Features

- ü§ñ Multiple LLM Provider Support (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, AWS Bedrock)
- üìß IMAP Email Monitoring
- ‚ö° Real-time Email Processing
- üîÑ Automatic Response Generation
- üéØ Smart Reply Filtering
- üåê Web-based Configuration Interface
- ‚è±Ô∏è Scheduled Email Checking

## Installation

```bash
pip install mailos
```

## Quick Start

1. Launch the web interface:

```bash
mailos
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

3. Click "Add New Checker" and configure your email account:
   - Email credentials (IMAP server, port, etc.)
   - LLM provider settings
   - Auto-reply preferences

## Configuration

### Email Settings
- IMAP server and port
- Email address and password
- Monitoring frequency

### LLM Provider Options

#### OpenAI

```json
{
    "llm_provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "api_key": "your-api-key"
}
```

#### Anthropic Claude

```json
{
    "llm_provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3-sonnet",
    "api_key": "your-api-key"
}
```

#### AWS Bedrock (Claude)

```json
{
    "llm_provider": "bedrock-anthropic",
    "model": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet",
    "aws_access_key": "your-access-key",
    "aws_secret_key": "your-secret-key",
    "aws_region": "us-east-1"
}
```

## Development

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomatyss/mailos.git
cd mailos
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## Architecture

The package consists of several key components:

1. **Email Monitor**: Continuously checks for new emails using IMAP

```python:src/mailos/check_emails.py
startLine: 29
endLine: 78
```

2. **LLM Integration**: Supports multiple AI providers through a unified interface

```python:src/mailos/vendors/models.py
startLine: 8
endLine: 65
```

3. **Reply Handler**: Manages email response generation and filtering

```python:src/mailos/reply.py
startLine: 169
endLine: 192
```
