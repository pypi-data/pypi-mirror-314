Datasette plugin for making quick charts from tables and SQL queries using Apex Charts

## Installation

To add this to your Datasette installation, install the plugin like so:
```bash
pip install datasette-quickchart
```
The plugin will then add itself to every Datasette table and query view.

## Features

| Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Many types of charts | + | Line, scatter, area, bar, stacked bar and pie.  |
| Works in both table and query wievs | + ||
| Fast | + | Data is loaded only once. Nothing is loaded or processed until you click 'Open Quick Chart', so normal operations in Datasette will not be slowed down in any way. |
| Keeps settings | + | With the current settings saved in sessionStorage, the chart persists across actions like sorting, moving to the next page of results, and so on. |
| Interactive | + | The chart supports zooming, scrolling, and other interactions. |
| Export | + | The chart supports exporting to PNG or SVG formats. |
| Aggregation | + | Data can be aggregated as a sum or an average. More advanced aggregations are possible through appropriate SQL queries or views. |
| Considers all data | + | The chart shows all data (retrieved by the plugin using Datasette's JSON API with the _size=max option), not just the data visible on the current results page. |
| Recognition of data types | + | The plugin analyzes all data in each column and assigns it one of the following types: numeric, categorical, date/time or null (if all values in the column are null). Timestamps are interpreted as numbers. I donâ€™t know how to change that yet. |
