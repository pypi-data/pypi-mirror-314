# ThermoEngine(Lite) Python package
For a fully functional thermoengine installation see https://enki-portal.gitlab.io/ThermoEngine/.

This is a work in progress... please be patient as we refactor thermoengine to enable local installation on all major architectures. The most up-to-date versions in this process will be posted here. For updates on the project see http://www.enki-portal.org.

Modules in this package are documented at https://enki-portal.gitlab.io/ThermoEngine/, and use case examples may be found within the Notebooks folder located at the project root.
