    This method will be responsible for creating a card/data-update based on the `mode`.
    There are three possible modes taken by this function.
        - render :
            - This will render the "final" card.
            - This mode is passed at task completion.
            - Setting this mode will call the `render` method of a MetaflowCard.
            - It will result in the creation of an HTML page.
        - render_runtime:
            - Setting this mode will render a card during task "runtime".
            - Setting this mode will call the `render_runtime` method of a MetaflowCard.
            - It will result in the creation of an HTML page.
        - refresh:
            - Setting this mode will refresh the data update for a card.
            - We support this mode because rendering a full card can be an expensive operation, but shipping tiny data updates can be cheap.
            - Setting this mode will call the `refresh` method of a MetaflowCard.
            - It will result in the creation of a JSON object.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    mf_card : MetaflowCard
        MetaflowCard object which will be used to render the card.
    mode : str
        Mode of rendering the card.
    task : Task
        Task object which will be passed to render the card.
    data : dict
        object created and passed down from `current.card._get_latest_data` method.
        For more information on this object's schema have a look at `current.card._get_latest_data` method.
    timeout_value : int
        Timeout value for rendering the card.
    
    Returns
    -------
    CardRenderInfo
        - NamedTuple which will contain:
            - `mode`: The mode of rendering the card.
            - `is_implemented`: whether the function was implemented or not.
            - `data` : output from rendering the card (Can be string/dict)
            - `timed_out` : whether the function timed out or not.
            - `timeout_stack_trace` : stack trace of the function if it timed out.
