Creating Ethereum, Bitcoin and other accounts is complex and fraught
with potential for loss of funds.

A 12- or 24-word BIP-39 seed recovery Mmnemonic Phrase helps, but a
*single* lapse in security dooms the account (and all derived accounts,
in fact).  If someone finds your recovery phrase (or you lose it), the
accounts derived from that seed are /gone/.

The SLIP-39 standard allows you to split the seed between 1, 2, or more
groups of several mnemonic recovery phrases.  This is better, but
creating such accounts is difficult; presently, only the Trezor supports
these directly, and they can only be created "manually".  Writing down 5
or more sets of 20 words is difficult, error-prone and time consuming.

1 Hardware Wallet "Seed" Configuration
══════════════════════════════════════

        Your keys, your Bitcoin.  Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.

        —Andreas Antonopoulos

  The [python-slip39] project (and the [SLIP-39 macOS/win32 App]) exists
  to assist in the safe creation, backup and documentation of
  [Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet] seeds and derived accounts,
  with various SLIP-39 sharing parameters.  It generates the new random
  wallet seed, and generates the expected standard Ethereum account(s)
  (at [derivation path] *m/44'/60'/0'/0/0* by default) and Bitcoin
  accounts (at Bech32 derivation path *m/84'/0'/0'/0/0* by default),
  with wallet address and QR code (compatible with Trezor and Ledger
  derivations).  It produces the required SLIP-39 phrases, and outputs a
  single PDF containing all the required printable cards to document the
  seed (and the specified derived accounts).

  On an secure (ideally air-gapped) computer, new seeds can /safely/ be
  generated (*without trusting this program*) and the PDF saved to a USB
  drive for printing (or directly printed without the file being saved
  to disk.).  Presently, `slip39' can output example ETH, BTC, LTC,
  DOGE, BSC, and XRP addresses derived from the seed, to /illustrate/
  what accounts are associated with the backed-up seed.  Recovery of the
  seed to a [Trezor Safe 3] is simple, by entering the mnemonics right
  on the device.

  We also support the backup of existing insecure and unreliable 12- or
  24-word BIP-39 Mnemonic Phrases as SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards, for
  existing BIP-39 hardware wallets like the [Ledger Nano], etc.!  Use
  your existing BIP-39 Phrase as your Seed Source, select "Using BIP-39"
  (and enter your BIP-39 passphrase), and generate a set of SLIP-39
  Mnemonic cards.  Later, use the SLIP-39 App and set your Seed Source
  to Recover from your SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards, click "Using BIP-39" to
  get your BIP-39 Mnemonic back, and use it (and your passphrase) to
  recover your accounts to your Ledger (or other) hardware wallet.

  Output of BIP-38 or JSON encrypted Paper Wallets is also supported,
  for import into standard software cryptocurrency wallets.

1.1 TL;DR Backup and Recover your BIP-39 Mnemonic
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Here's a full round-trip demonstration of:
  • Creating new (or "Backing Up" existing) Seed Entropy as a BIP-39
    Mnemonic
  • Recovering the Seed Entropy from SLIP-39 (via
    <https://iancoleman.io/slip39/>)
  • Recovering the original BIP-39 (via <https://iancoleman.io/bip39/>)

  First, we generate SLIP-39 Cards representing a BIP-39 Mnemonic seed.
  Remember, your BIP-39 Mnemonic simply encodes your 128- or 256-bit
  Seed Entropy.  So, we're not backing up your Mnemonic phrase – we're
  backing up the raw seed data that is encoded into your BIP-39
  Mnemonic.

  ┌────
  │ # python3 -m pip install slip39; slip39 -q --using-bip39  # to generate one from scratch, or
  │ slip39 --secret "seven replace great luggage fox rent general tower guess inside smile sing"
  └────

  SLIP39-2024-12-08+14.59.42-ETH-0x6E6268F14B922cb924C7683A415B30C2bf967000.pdf

  <./images/SLIP39-backup-BIP39.png>

  If you look at the generated SLIP39 PDF, you'll see that the cover
  page contains the original BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase (for confirmation),
  and generates a number of SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards.  These cards encode
  the original Seed Entropy, and are what you use to recover the BIP-39
  Mnemonic whenever you need it.

  I *recommend* that you /tear off and destroy/ the BIP-39 Mnemonic from
  the cover sheet, once you've confirmed you can recover it anytime you
  want, and you've set up your hardware wallet, and confirmed that it
  contains the same cryptocurrency addresses displayed in the PDF.

  <./images/SLIP39-recover-BIP39-entropy.png>

  Practice this full round-trip several times with a bad BIP-39 Mnemonic
  like "zoo zoo … wrong".  This is the only way to become comfortable
  with your ability to recover your original seed data, and (hence) your
  BIP-39 Mnemonic.

  Later, when you need to recover your BIP-39 Seed Entropy and Mnemonic,
  use this SLIP-39 App or <https://iancoleman.io/slip39/> and enter some
  of your SLIP-39 Mnemonic Cards.  These may need to be collected from
  friends and family.

  <./images/SLIP39-recover-BIP39-mnemonic.png>

  In this case, we're using the First and Second cards, intended for you
  to secure, separately from each other; for example, in two safes or
  other secure locations like locked filing cabinets, at 2 locations
  known to you and your partner(s):

  Finally, convert the recovered Seed Entropy back to your BIP-39
  Mnemonic.  This requires 2 steps if you use
  <https://iancoleman.io/bip39/>

  In this step, we're simply converting the recovered Seed Entropy back
  into its BIP-39 Mnemonic.  You need to select the "[X] show entropy
  details" checkbox in order to enter the raw Seed Entropy we've
  recovered in the last step:

  Alternatively, you can use the SLIP-39 App or the `slip39-recovery'
  command-line tool, and do it all in one step.  This illustrates
  recovering your BIP-39 Mnemonic from the SLIP-39 Cards generated in
  the first step:

  ┌────
  │ python3 -m slip39.recovery --using-bip39 \
  │   -m "pitch negative acrobat romp desert usual negative darkness friar artist estimate aluminum beard crowd email season guard hybrid kidney cards" \
  │   -m "pitch negative beard romp diagnose timely ruler emission acrobat adult stilt dress typical blue inmate lilac pajamas trend duration endless"

2 Security with Availability
════════════════════════════

  For both BIP-39 and SLIP-39, a 128- or 256-bit random "seed" is the
  source of an unlimited sequence of Ethereum and Bitcoin Heirarchical
  Deterministic (HD) derived Wallet accounts.  Anyone who can obtain
  this seed gains control of all Ethereum, Bitcoin (and other) accounts
  derived from it, so it must be securely stored.

  Losing this seed means that all of the HD Wallet accounts are
  permanently lost.  It must be /both/ backed up securely, /and/ be
  readily accessible.

  Therefore, we must:

  • Ensure that nobody untrustworthy can recover the seed, but
  • Store the seed in many places, probably with several (some perhaps
    untrustworthy) people.

  How can we address these conflicting requirements?


2.1 Shamir's Secret Sharing System (SSSS)
─────────────────────────────────────────

  [Satoshi Lab's (Trezor) SLIP-39] uses SSSS to distribute the ability
  to recover the key to 1 or more "groups".  Collecting the mnemonics
  from the required number of groups allows recovery of the seed.

  For BIP-39, the number of groups is always 1, and the number of
  mnemonics required for that group is always 1.  This selection is both
  insecure (easy to accidentally disclose) and unreliable (easy to
  accidentally lose), but since most hardware wallets *only* accept
  BIP-39 phrases, we also provide a way to /backup your BIP-39 phrase/
  using SLIP-39!

  For SLIP-39, you specify a "group_threshold" of /how many/ of your
  groups must be successfully collected, to recover the seed; this seed
  is (conceptually) split between 1 or more groups (though not in
  reality – each group's data /alone/ gives away /no information/ about
  the seed).

  For example, you might have First, Second, Fam and Frens groups, and
  decide that any 2 groups can be combined to recover the seed.  Each
  group has members with varying levels of trust and persistence, so
  have different number of Members, and differing numbers Required to
  recover that group's data:

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Group   Required     Members  Description                           
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   First          1  /  1        Stored at home                        
   Second         1  /  1        Stored in office safe                 
   Fam            2  /  4        Distributed to family members         
   Frens          3  /  6        Distributed to friends and associates 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  The account owner might store their First and Second group data in
  their home and office safes.  These are 1/1 groups (1 required, and
  only 1 member, so each of these are 1-card groups.)

  If the Seed needs to be recovered, collecting the First and Second
  cards from the home and office safe is sufficient to recover the Seed,
  and re-generate all of the HD Wallet accounts.

  Only 2 Fam group member's cards must be collected to recover the Fam
  group's data.  So, if the HD Wallet owner loses their home (and the
  one and only First group card) in a fire, they could get the one
  Second group card from the office safe, and also 2 cards from Fam
  group members, and recover the Seed and all of their wallets.

  If catastrophe strikes and the wallet owner dies, and the heirs don't
  have access to either the First (at home) or Second (at the office)
  cards, they can collect 2 Fam cards and 3 Frens cards (at the funeral,
  for example), completing the Fam and Frens groups' data, and recover
  the Seed, and all derived HD Wallet accounts.

  Since Frens are less likely to persist long term, we'll produce more
  (6) of these cards.  Depending on how trustworthy the group is, adjust
  the Fren group's Required number higher (less trustworthy, more likely
  to know each-other, need to collect more to recover the group), or
  lower (more trustworthy, less likely to collude, need less to
  recover).

3 SLIP-39 Account Creation, Recovery and Generation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Generating a new SLIP-39 encoded Seed is easy, with results available
  as PDF and text.  Any number of derived HD wallet account addresses
  can be generated from this Seed, and the Seed (and all derived HD
  wallets, for all cryptocurrencies) can be recovered by collecting the
  desired groups of recover card phrases.  The default recovery groups
  are as described above.


3.1 Creating New SLIP-39 Recoverable Seeds
──────────────────────────────────────────

  This is what the first page of the output SLIP-39 mnemonic cards PDF
  looks like:

  <./images/slip39-cards.png>

  Run the following to obtain a PDF file containing business cards with
  the default SLIP-39 groups for a new account Seed named "Personal"
  (usable with any hardware wallet with SLIP-39 support, such as the
  Trezor Safe) ; insert a USB drive to collect the output, and run:

  ┌────
  │ $ python3 -m pip install slip39        # Install slip39 in Python3
  │ $ cd /Volumes/USBDRIVE/                # Change current directory to USB
  │ $ python3 -m slip39 Personal           # Or just run "slip39 Personal"

  └────
  The resultant PDF will be output into the designated file.

  This PDF file contains business card sized SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards, and
  will print on a single page of 8-1/2"x11" paper or card stock, and the
  cards can be cut out (`--card index', `credit', `half' (page), `third'
  and `quarter' are also available, as well as 4x6 `photo' and custom
  `"(<h>,<w>),<margin>"').

  To get the data printed on the terminal as in this example (so you
  could write it down on cards instead), add a `-v' (to see it logged in
  a tabular format), or `--text' to have it printed to stdout in full
  lines (ie. for pipelining to other programs).

╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  To obtain the Seed in BIP-39 format, with its original "entropy"
  backed up using SLIP-39 (supporting any BIP-39 hardware wallet, and
  recoverable from the Mnemonic cards using SLIP-39), use the
  `--using-bip39' option:

  ┌────
  │ $ slip39 --using-bip39 Personal-BIP-39
  │ 2022-11-22 05:47:13 slip39.layout    ETH    m/44'/60'/0'/0/0    : 0x927232296120343A89DeAb15F108a420087a2Ef3

  └────
  This is the best approach, if you want a new Seed and need to support
  a BIP-39-only Hardware Wallet. (If you already have a BIP-39 Mnemonic
  Phrase, see 3.4.3)


3.1.2 Paper Wallets for Software Wallet Support
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The Trezor hardware wallet natively supports the input of SLIP-39
  Mnemonics.  However, most software wallets do not (yet) support
  SLIP-39.  So, how do we load the Crypto wallets produced from our Seed
  into software wallets such as the Metamask plugin or the Brave
  browser, for example?

  The `slip39.gui' (and the macOS/win32 SLIP-39.App) support output of
  standard BIP-38 encrypted wallets for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies
  such as BTC, LTC and DOGE.  It also outputs encrypted Ethereum JSON
  wallets for ETH.  Here is how to produce them (from a test secret
  Seed; exclude `--secret ffff...' for yours!):

  ┌────
  │ slip39 -c ETH -c BTC -c DOGE -c LTC --secret ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff \
  │     --no-card --wallet password --wallet-hint 'bad:pass...' 2>&1

  └────


  And what they look like:

  <./images/slip39-wallets.png>

  To recover your real SLIP-39 Seed Entropy and print wallets, use the
  SLIP-39 App's "Recover" Controls, or to do so on the command-line, use
  `slip39-recover':

  ┌────
  │ slip39-recovery -v \
  │     --mnemonic "material leaf acrobat romp charity capital omit skunk change firm eclipse crush fancy best tracks flip grownup plastic chew peanut" \
  │     --mnemonic "material leaf beard romp disaster duke flame uncover group slice guest blue gums duckling total suitable trust guitar payment platform" \

  │ ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
  └────


  You can run this as a command-line pipeline.  Here, we use some
  SLIP-39 Mnemonics that encode the `ffff...' Seed Entropy; note that
  the wallets match those output above:

  ┌────
  │ slip39-recovery \
  │     --mnemonic "material leaf acrobat romp charity capital omit skunk change firm eclipse crush fancy best tracks flip grownup plastic chew peanut" \

3.1.3 Supported Cryptocurrencies
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  While the SLIP-39 Seed is not cryptocurrency-specific (any wallet for
  any cryptocurrency can be derived from it), each type of
  cryptocurrency has its own standard derivation path
  (eg. `m/44'/3'/0'/0/0' for DOGE), and its own address representation
  (eg. Bech32 at `m/84'/0'/0'/0/0' for BTC
  eg. `bc1qcupw7k8enymvvsa7w35j5hq4ergtvus3zk8a8s').

  When you import your SLIP-39 Seed into a Trezor, you gain access to
  all derived HD cryptocurrency wallets supported directly by that
  hardware wallet, and *indirectly*, to any coin and/or blockchain
  network supported by any wallet software (eg. Metamask).

◊ 3.1.3.1 ETH, BTC, LTC, DOGE

  These coins are natively supported both directly by the Trezor
  hardware wallet, and by most software wallets and "web3" platforms
  that interact with the Trezor, or can import the BIP-38 or Ethereum
  JSON Paper Wallets produced by `python-slip39'.


◊ 3.1.3.2 Binance Smart Chain (BSC): binance.com

  The Binance Smart Chain uses standard Ethereum addresses; support for
  the BSC is added directly to the wallet software; here are the
  instructions for adding BSC support for the Trezor hardware wallet,
  [using the Metamask software wallet].  In `python-slip39', BSC is
  simply an alias for ETH, since the wallet addresses and Ethereum JSON
  Paper Wallets are identical.

3.2 The macOS/win32 `SLIP-39.app' GUI App
─────────────────────────────────────────

  If you prefer a graphical user-interface, try the macOS/win32
  SLIP-39.App.  You can run it directly if you install Python 3.9+ from
  [python.org/downloads] or using homebrew `brew install
  python-tk@3.10'.  Then, start the GUI in a variety of ways:

  ┌────
  │ slip39-gui
  │ python3 -m slip39.gui
  └────
  Alternatively, download and install the macOS/win32 GUI App .zip, .pkg
  or .dmg installer from [github.com/pjkundert/python-slip-39/releases].

  Later, if you need to recover the wallet seed, keep entering SLIP-39
  mnemonics into `slip39-recovery' until the secret is recovered
  (invalid/duplicate mnemonics will be ignored):

  ┌────

  └────
  Finally, re-create the wallet seed, perhaps including an encrypted
  JSON Paper Wallet for import of some accounts into a software wallet
  (use `--json password' to output encrypted Ethereum JSON wallet
  files):

  │                         passphrase, '-' reads it from stdin (default: None/'')
  │ 
  │ If you obtain a threshold number of SLIP-39 mnemonics, you can recover the original
  │ secret Seed Entropy, and then re-generate one or more wallets from it.
  │ 
  │ Enter the mnemonics when prompted and/or via the command line with -m |--mnemonic "...".
  │ 
  │ The secret Seed Entropy can then be used to generate a new SLIP-39 encoded wallet:
  │ 
  │     python3 -m slip39 --secret = "ab04...7f"
  │ 
  │ SLIP-39 Mnemonics may be encrypted with a passphrase; this is *not* Ledger-compatible, so it rarely
  │ recommended!  Typically, on a Trezor, you recover using your SLIP-39 Mnemonics, and then use the
  │ "Hidden wallet" feature (passwords entered on the device) to produce alternative sets of accounts.
  │ 
  │ BIP-39 Mnemonics can be backed up as SLIP-39 Mnemonics, in two ways:
  │ 
  │ 1) The actual BIP-39 standard 512-bit Seed can be generated by supplying --passphrase, but only at
  │ the cost of 59-word SLIP-39 mnemonics.  This is because the *output* 512-bit BIP-39 Seed must be
  │ stored in SLIP-39 -- not the *input* 128-, 160-, 192-, 224-, or 256-bit entropy used to create the
  │ original BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.
  │ 
  │ 2) The original BIP-39 12- or 24-word, 128- to 256-bit Seed Entropy can be recovered by supplying
  │ --entropy.  This modifies the BIP-39 recovery to return the original BIP-39 Mnemonic Entropy, before
  │ decryption and seed generation.  It has no effect for SLIP-39 recovery.

╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The tools can be used in a pipeline to avoid printing the secret.
  Here we generate some mnemonics, sorting them in reverse order so we
  need more than just the first couple to recover.  Observe the Ethereum
  wallet address generated.

  Then, we recover the master secret seed in hex with `slip39-recovery',
  and finally send it to `slip39 --secret -' to re-generate the same
  wallet as we originally created.

╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  A primary use case for `python-slip39' will be to backup an existing
  BIP-39 Mnemonic Phrase to SLIP-39 cards, so here it is.  Suppose you
  have some (arbitrary) way to recover (or generate) some Entropy; for
  example, by recovering the original seed entropy used to generate a
  BIP-39 Mhemonic:

  Better yet, if you already have a BIP-39 Mnemonic, you can just use
  that directly (we'll use a bit of "wrapping" around the filename
  output, so the first page shows up here):

  ┌────
  │ echo -n "[[./$( \
  │         python3 -m slip39 --secret "zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo wrong" --output ./images/SLIP39-Example.pdf \
  │ )]]"
  │ 
  └────

  <././images/SLIP39-Example.pdf>

  Note the presence of the BIP-39 recovery phrase on the cover sheet;
  this is recovered by round-tripping the original BIP-39 seed entropy,
  through SLIP-39, and re-encoding back to BIP-39.


3.5 Generation of Addresses
───────────────────────────

  For systems that require a stream of groups of wallet Addresses
  (eg. for preparing invoices for clients, with a choice of
  cryptocurrency payment options), `slip-generator' can produce a stream
  of groups of addresses.

3.5.3 X Public Keys
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  If you prefer, you can output "xpub…" format public keys, instead of
  account addresses.  By default, this will elide the non-hardened
  portion of the default addresses – use the "xpub…"  keys to produce
  the remaining non-hardened portion of the HD wallet paths locally.

  For example, assume you must produce a sequence of accounts for each
  client client of your company to deposit into.  Your highly secure
  serial-connected "key enclave" system (which must know your HD wallet
  seed) emits a sequence of xpubkeys for each new client over a serial
  cable, to your accounting system:

  Since you have to generate such an xpubkey from a "hardened" path,
  such as with `slip39.generate --xpub ...', you *still* need to run
  that tool chain on some secure "air gapped" computer.  So, how do you
  do that safely, knowing that you need to input your SLIP-39 or BIP-39
  Mnemonics on that computer?  Especially, if you want to do this under
  any kind of automation, and deliver the output xpubkey to your
  insecure business computer systems?

  One solution is to have the computer hosting your Seed or Mnemonic
  private key material *only* connected to your business computer
  systems with a guaranteed *safe* mechanism.  Definitely *not* with any
  kind of general purpose network system!

  The solution: *The RS-232 Serial Port*

  With USB to [DB-9 female] to [DB-9 male] serial adapters, any small
  computer with USB ports (such as the [Raspberry Pi 400]) can be
  connected serially and serve as your "secure" computer, storing your
  Seed Mnemonic.

  Remember to disable all other wired and wireless networking!

  The RS-232 port on the "secure" computer can be protected from all
  incoming data transmissions, make an exploit effectively impossible,
  while still allowing outgoing data (the generated xpubkeys).

  A DB-9 [serial breakout] board or custom serial adapter be easily
  constructed that disconnects pin 3 (TXD) on the "business" side from
  pin 2 (RXD) on the "secure" side, eliminating any chance of data being
  sent to the "secure" side.  The only electronic connection that
  transmits data to the "secure" side is the hardware flow control pin 7
  (RTS) to pin 8 (CTS).  An exploit using this single-bit approach
  vector is … unlikely. :)

3.6.4 `slip39.recover'
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Takes a number of SLIP-39 mnemonics, and if sufficient
  `group_threshold' groups' mnemonics are present (and the options
  `passphrase' is supplied), the `master_secret' is recovered.  This can
  be used with `slip39.accounts' to directly obtain any `Account' data.

  Note that the SLIP-39 passphrase is *not* checked; entering a
  different passphrase for the same set of mnemonics will recover a
  *different* wallet!  This is by design; it allows the holder of the
  SLIP-39 mnemonic phrases to recover a "decoy" wallet by supplying a
  specific passphrase, while protecting the "primary" wallet.

  Therefore, it is *essential* to remember any non-default (non-empty)
  passphrase used, separately and securely.  Take great care in deciding
  if you wish to use a passphrase with your SLIP-39 wallet!

4 Conversion from BIP-39 to SLIP-39
═══════════════════════════════════

  If we already have a BIP-39 wallet, it would certainly be nice to be
  able to create nice, safe SLIP-39 mnemonics for it, and discard the
  unsafe BIP-39 mnemonics we have lying around, just waiting to be
  accidentally discovered and the account compromised!

  Fortunately, *we can* do this!  It takes a bit of practice to become
  comfortable with the process, but once you do – you can confidently
  discard your original insecure and unreliable BIP-39 Mnemonic backups.


4.1 BIP-39 vs. SLIP-39 Incompatibility

  Unfortunately, it is *not possible* to cleanly convert a BIP-39
  /generated/ wallet Seed into a SLIP-39 wallet.  Both BIP-39 and
  SLIP-39 preserve the original 128- to 256-bit Seed Entropy (random)
  bits, but these bits are used *very differently* – and incompatibly –
  to generate the resultant wallet Seed.

  In native SLIP-39, the original, recovered Seed Entropy (128- or
  256-bits) is used directly by the BIP-44 wallet derivation.  In
  BIP-39, the Seed entropy is not directly used /at all/!  It is only
  *indirectly* used; the BIP-39 Seed Phrase (which contains the exact,
  original entropy) is used, as normalized text, as input to a hashing
  function, along with some other fixed text, to produce a 512-bit Seed,
  which is then fed into the BIP-44 wallet derivation process.

  The least desirable method is to preserve the 512-bit *output* of the
  BIP-39 mnemonic phrase as a set of 512-bit (59-word) SLIP-39
  Mnemonics.  But first, lets review how BIP-39 works.


4.1.1 BIP-39 Entropy to Mnemonic
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  BIP-39 uses a single set of 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 BIP-39 words to
  carefully preserve a specific 128 to 256 bits of initial Seed Entropy.
  Here's a 128-bit (12-word) example using some fixed "entropy"
  `0xFFFF..FFFF'.  You'll note that, from the BIP-39 Mnemonic, we can
  either recover the original 128-bit Seed Entropy, *or* we can generate
  the resultant 512-bit Seed w/ the correct passphrase:

  ┌────
  │ from mnemonic import Mnemonic
  │ bip39_english     = Mnemonic("english")
  │ entropy           = b'\xFF' * 16
  │ entropy_hex       = codecs.encode( entropy, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
  │ entropy_mnemonic  = bip39_english.to_mnemonic( entropy )
  │ 
  │ recovered         = slip39.recover_bip39( entropy_mnemonic, as_entropy=True )
  │ recovered_hex     = codecs.encode( recovered, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
  │ 
  │ recovered_seed    = slip39.recover_bip39( entropy_mnemonic, passphrase=passphrase )
  │ recovered_seed_hex= codecs.encode( recovered_seed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
  │ 
  │ [
  │     [ "Original Entropy", entropy_hex ],
  │     [ "BIP-39 Mnemonic", entropy_mnemonic ],
  │     [ "Recovered Entropy", recovered_hex ],
  │     [ "Recovered Seed", f"{recovered_seed_hex:.50}..." ],
  │ ]
  └────

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Each word is one of a corpus of 2048 words; therefore, each word
  encodes 11 bits (2048 = 2**11) of entropy.  So, we provided 128 bits,
  but 12*11 = 132.  So where does the extra 4 bits of data come from?

  It comes from the first few bits of a SHA256 hash of the entropy,
  which is added to the end of the supplied 128 bits, to reach the
  required 132 bits: 132 / 11 = 12 words.

  This last 4 bits (up to 8 bits, for a 256-bit 24-word BIP-39) is
  checked, when validating the BIP-39 mnemonic.  Therefore, making up a
  random BIP-39 mnemonic will succeed only 1 / 16 times on average, due
  to an incorrect checksum 4-bit (16 = 2**4) .  Lets check:

  ┌────
  │ def random_words( n, count=100 ):
  │     for _ in range( count ):
  │         yield ' '.join( random.choice( bip39_english.wordlist ) for _ in range( n ))
  │ 
  │ successes           = sum(
  │     bip39_english.check( m )
  │     for i,m in enumerate( random_words( 12, 10000 ))) / 100
  │ 
  │ [
  │     [ "Valid random 12-word mnemonics:", f"{successes}%" ],
  │     [ "Or, about: ", f"1 / {100/successes:.3}" ],
  │ ]
  └────

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Valid random 12-word mnemonics:     6.33% 
   Or, about:                       1 / 15.8 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Sure enough, about 1/16 random 12-word phrases are valid BIP-39
  mnemonics.  OK, we've got the contents of the BIP-39 phrase dialed in.
  How is it used to generate accounts?


4.1.2 BIP-39 Mnemonic to Seed
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Unfortunately, BIP-39 does *not* use the carefully preserved 128-bit
  entropy to generate the wallet!  Nope, it is stretched to a 512-bit
  seed using PBKDF2 HMAC SHA512.  The normalized *text* (/not the
  Entropy bytes/) of the 12-word mnemonic is then used (with a salt of
  "mnemonic" plus an optional passphrase, "" by default), to obtain the
  512-bit seed:

  ┌────
  │ seed                = bip39_english.to_seed( entropy_mnemonic )
  │ seed_hex            = codecs.encode( seed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
  │ [
  │     [ f"{len(seed)*8}-bit seed:", f"{seed_hex:.50}..." ]
  │ ]
  └────

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   512-bit seed:  b6a6d8921942dd9806607ebc2750416b289adea669198769f2… 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


4.1.3 BIP-39 Seed to Address
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Finally, this 512-bit seed is used to derive HD wallet(s).  The HD
  Wallet key derivation process consumes whatever seed entropy is
  provided (512 bits in the case of BIP-39), and uses HMAC SHA512 with a
  prefix of b"Bitcoin seed" to stretch the supplied seed entropy to 64
  bytes (512 bits).  Then, the HD Wallet *path* segments are iterated
  through, permuting the first 32 bytes of this material as the key with
  the second 32 bytes of material as the chain node, until finally the
  32-byte (256-bit) Ethereum account private key is produced.  We then
  use this private key to compute the rest of the Ethereum account
  details, such as its public address.

  ┌────
  │ path                = "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0"
  │ bip39_eth_hd        = slip39.account( seed, 'ETH', path )
  │ [
  │     [ f"{len(bip39_eth_hd.key)*4}-bit derived key path:", f"{path}" ],
  │     [ "Produces private key: ", f"{bip39_eth_hd.key}" ],
  │     [ "Yields Ethereum address:", f"{bip39_eth_hd.address}" ],
  │ ]
  └────

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   256-bit derived key path:  m/44'/60'/0'/0/0                                                 
   Produces private key:      7af65ba4dd53f23495dcb04995e96f47c243217fc279f10795871b725cd009ae 
   Yields Ethereum address:   0xfc2077CA7F403cBECA41B1B0F62D91B5EA631B5E                       
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Thus, we see that while the 12-word BIP-39 mnemonic careful preserves
  the original 128-bit entropy, this data is not directly used to derive
  the wallet private key and address.  Also, since an irreversible hash
  is used to derive the Seed from the Mnemonic, we can't reverse the
  process on the seed to arrive back at the BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.


4.1.4 SLIP-39 Entropy to Mnemonic
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Just like BIP-39 carefully preserves the original 128-bit Seed Entropy
  bytes in a single 12-word mnemonic phrase, SLIP-39 preserves the
  original 128- or 256-bit Seed Entropy in a /set/ of 20- or 33-word
  Mnemonic phrases.

  Since there is some randomness used in the SLIP-39 mnemonics
  generation process, we would get a *different* set of words each time
  for the fixed "entropy" `0xFFFF..FF' used in this example (if we
  hadn't manually disabled entropy for `shamir_mnemonic', above), but we
  will *always* derive the same Ethereum account `0x824b..19a1' at the
  specified HD Wallet derivation path.

4.1.5 SLIP-39 Mnemonic to Seed
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Lets prove that we can actually recover the *original* Seed Entropy
  from the SLIP-39 recovery Mnemonics; in this case, we've specified a
  SLIP-39 group_threshold of 2 groups, so we'll use 1 Mnemonic from
  Mine, and 2 from the Fam group:

  ┌────
  │ _,mnem_mine         = grps['Mine']
  │ _,mnem_fam          = grps['Fam']
  │ recseed             = slip39.recover( mnem_mine + mnem_fam[:2] )
  │ recseed_hex         = codecs.encode( recseed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
  │ [
  │     [ f"{len(recseed)*8}-bit Seed:", f"{recseed_hex}" ]
  │ ]
  └────

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   128-bit Seed:  ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


4.1.6 SLIP-39 Seed to Address
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  And we'll use the same style of code as for the BIP-39 example above,
  to derive the Ethereum address *directly* from this recovered 128-bit
  seed:

  ┌────
  │ slip39_eth_hd       = slip39.account( recseed, 'ETH', path )
  │ [
  │     [ f"{len(slip39_eth_hd.key)*4}-bit derived key path:", f"{path}" ],
  │     [ "Produces private key: ", f"{slip39_eth_hd.key}" ],
  │     [ "Yields Ethereum address:", f"{slip39_eth_hd.address}" ],
  │ ]
  └────

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   256-bit derived key path:  m/44'/60'/0'/0/0                                                 
   Produces private key:      6a2ec39aab88ec0937b79c8af6aaf2fd3c909e9a56c3ddd32ab5354a06a21a2b 
   Yields Ethereum address:   0x824b174803e688dE39aF5B3D7Cd39bE6515A19a1                       
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  And we see that we obtain the same Ethereum address `0x824b..1a2b' as
  we originally got from `slip39.create' above.  However, this is *not
  the same* Ethereum wallet address obtained from BIP-39 with exactly
  the same `0xFFFF...FF' Seed Entropy, which was `0xfc20..1B5E'!

  This is due to the fact that BIP-39 does not use the recovered Seed
  Entropy to produce the seed like SLIP-39 does, but applies additional
  one-way hashing of the Mnemonic to produce a 512-bit Seed.


4.2 BIP-39 vs SLIP-39 Key Derivation Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────

  At no time in BIP-39 account derivation is the original 128-bit Seed
  Entropy used (directly) in the derivation of the wallet key.  This
  differs from SLIP-39, which directly uses the 128-bit Seed Entropy
  recovered from the SLIP-39 Shamir's Secret Sharing System recovery
  process to generate each HD Wallet account's private key.

  Furthermore, there is no point in the BIP-39 Seed Entropy to account
  generation where we *could* introduce a known 128-bit seed and produce
  a known Ethereum wallet from it, other than at the very beginning.

  Therefore, our BIP-39 Backup via SLIP-39 strategy must focus on
  backing up the original 128- to 256-bit Seed /Entropy/, *not* the
  output Seed data!


4.3 BIP-39 Backup via SLIP-39
─────────────────────────────

  Here are the two available methods for backing up insecure and
  unreliable BIP-39 Mnemonic phrases, using SLIP-39.

  The first "Emergency Recovery" method allows you to recover your
  BIP-39 generated wallets *without the passphrase*, but does not
  support recovery using hardware wallets; you must output "Paper
  Wallets" and use them to recover the Cryptocurrency funds.

  The second "Best Recovery: Using Recovered BIP-39 Mnemonic Phrase"
  allows us to recover the accounts to /any/ standard BIP-39 hardware
  wallet!  However, the SLIP-39 Mnemonics are *not* compatible with
  standard SLIP-39 wallets like the Trezor – you have to use the
  recovered BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase to recover the hardware wallet.


4.3.1 Emergency Recovery: Using Recovered Paper Wallets
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  There is one approach which can preserve an original BIP-39
  /generated/ wallet addresses, using SLIP-39 mnemonics.

  It is clumsy, as it preserves the BIP-39 *output* 512-bit stretched
  seed, and the resultant 59-word SLIP-39 mnemonics cannot be used (at
  present) with the Trezor hardware wallet.  They can, however, be used
  to recover the HD wallet private keys without access to the original
  BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase /or passphrase/ – you could generate and
  distribute a set of more secure SLIP-39 Mnemonic phrases, instead of
  trying to secure the original BIP-39 mnemonic + passphrase – without
  abandoning your existing BIP-39 wallets.

  We'll use `slip39.recovery --bip39 ...' to recover the 512-bit
  stretched seed from BIP-39:

  ┌────
  │ ( python3 -m slip39.recovery --bip39 -v \
  │     --mnemonic "zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo wrong" 
  │ ) 2>&1

  └────

  Then we can generate a 59-word SLIP-39 mnemonic set from the 512-bit
  secret:

  This `0xfc20..1B5E' address is the same Ethereum address as is
  recovered on a Trezor using this BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.  Thus, we can
  generate "Paper Wallets" for the desired Cryptocurrency accounts, and
  recover the funds.

  So, this does the job:
  • Uses our original BIP-39 Mnemonic
  • Does not require remembering the BIP-39 passphrase
  • Preserves all of the original wallets

  But:
  • The 59-word SLIP-39 Mnemonics cannot (yet) be imported into the
    Trezor
  • The original BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase cannot be recovered, for any
    hardware wallet
  • Must use the SLIP-39 App to generate "Paper Wallets", to recover the
    funds

  So, this is a good "emergency backup" solution; you or your heirs
  would be able to recover the funds with a very high level of security
  and reliability.


4.3.2 Best Recovery: Using Recovered BIP-39 Mnemonic Phrase
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The best solution is to use SLIP-39 to back up the original BIP-39
  Seed /Entropy/ (/not/ the generated Seed), and then later recover that
  Seed Entropy and re-generate the BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase.  You will
  continue to need to remember and use your original BIP-39 passphrase:

  <file:images/BIP-39-backup-entropy.png>

  First, observe that we can recover the 128-bit Seed Entropy from the
  BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase (not the 512-bit generated Seed):
  ┌────

  Now we generate SLIP-39 Mnemonics to recover the 128-bit Seed Entropy.
  Note that these are 20-word Mnemonics.  However, these are *NOT* the
  wallets we expected!  These are the well-known native SLIP-39 wallets
  from the `0xFFFF...FF' Seed Entropy; not the well-known native BIP-39
  wallets from that Seed Entropy, which generate the Ethereum wallet
  address `0xfc20..1B5E'!  Why not?

  And, there we have it – we've recovered exactly the same Ethereum and
  Bitcoin wallets as would a native BIP-39 hardware wallet like a Ledger
  Nano.


◊ 4.3.2.1 Using SLIP-39 App "Backup" Controls

  In the SLIP-39 App, the default Controls presented are to "Backup" a
  BIP-39 recovery phrase.

  In "Seed Source", enter your existing BIP-39 recovery phrase.  In
  "Seed Secret", make sure "Using BIP-39" is selected, and enter your
  BIP-39 passphrase.  This allows us to display the proper wallet
  addresses – we do *not* store your password, or save it as part of the
  SLIP-39 cards!  You will need to remember and use your passphrase
  whenever you use your BIP-39 phrase to initialize a hardware wallet.

  Check that the Recovery needs … Mnemonic Card Groups are correct for
  your application, and hit Save!

  Later, use the "Recover" Controls to get your BIP-39 recovery phrase
  back, from your SLIP-39 cards, whenever you need it.

  Practice this a few times (using the "zoo zoo … wrong" 12-word or "zoo
  zoo … vote" 24-word phrase) until you're confident.  Then, back up
  your real BIP-39 recovery phrase.

  Once you're convinced you can securely and reliably recover your
  BIP-39 phrase any time you need it, we recommend that you destroy your
  original BIP-39 recovery phrase backup(s).  They are dangerous and
  unreliable, and only serve to make your Cryptocurrency accounts *less*
  secure!


5 Cryptocurrency Invoicing and Licensing
════════════════════════════════════════

  A valuable use of Cryptocurrency accounts is to send or receive
  payments for goods, services or remittances/donations.  The global
  monetary system makes this very difficult (or even impossible),
  especially if any of the corporations or governments involved in the
  transaction are hostile to you or any of the other individuals
  attempting to transact business.

  Worse yet, your business or family can be arbitrarily ejected from the
  financial system by an of the many intermediary banking industry and
  government parties involved in any traditional financial transaction,
  even if you are not convicted of a crime.

  Even if such payments are allowed, and none of the counterparties are
  actively hostile to you, the complexity and expense of quoting a
  price, signing a client, invoicing for payment, confirming the
  validity of the invoice and making the payment, monitoring for
  incoming payments and associating them with the correct invoices,
  conforming amounts paid are correct, issuing a receipt, book-keeping
  the incoming payment, converting currencies, retaining the correct
  taxes for each counterparty jurisdiction, reconciling books, and
  finally preparing and filing taxes, and then (perhaps years later)
  defending your accounting decisions against a hostile tax inspector
  with infinite funds to prosecute – all this makes it virtually
  impossible for a small business to survive.  Furthermore, you must
  accomplish all this, *without error*, while attempting to defend
  yourself against business adversaries with preferential tax treatment,
  office-towers full of lawyers and accountants, for whom the total
  percentage of gross revenues paid to accomplish compliance is less
  than 1%, while the small business is likely to spend 10% to 25% of
  their entire gross revenue *just* to financial and regulatory
  compliance overheads.

  Fortunately, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) provides you with the
  capability to receive payments, quickly and efficiently, from anyone
  on the planet who wishes to pay you for your services.

  Your software can use a variety of means to verify payment, and then
  license use of the various functionality of your software.


5.1 Using Plain HD Wallet Accounts
──────────────────────────────────

  If your needs are simple, you can [securely generate an `xpub...' key]
  using a unique HD Wallet derivation path for each separate enterprise
  you wish to receive funds for.  If this is done in a secure
  (ie. air-gapped) environment, then this `xpub...' key can safely be
  used to generate a sequence of HD Wallet addresses for each "client"
  you wish to charge.

  The client deposits cryptocurrency, and you (later) transfer or
  aggregate it as you wish – using your normal, secure (ie. Hardware
  Wallet) transfer process.

  This is simplest for the client, as they can buy Cryptocurrency on any
  exchange, and simply "withdraw" the correct amount of Cryptocurrency
  to the given account.  However, these is no other information attached
  to the transaction – all "licensing" verification takes place
  manually, outside the cryptocurrency system.

  So, generating a sequence of plain (Externally Owned Account, or EOA)
  client addresses from an `xpub...' is a worthwhile solution to
  consider.  However, it does have some drawbacks:


[securely generate an `xpub...' key] See section 3.5.3

5.1.1 Fee Distribution
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Collecting up all the clients' payments later is a manual process.  If
  you wish to distribute the payments (say, to pay partners, or a
  licensor whose software you sub-licensed, or to ensure that *you* get
  paid should someone license your software), this must all be done
  manually.


5.1.2 ERC-20 Tokens
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  If ERC-20 tokens are accepted into the generated EOA addresses, then
  you must transfer Ethereum into the account first, before transferring
  out the ERC-20 tokens.  This requires at least one additional transfer
  fee, and since Gas fees are now variable, may result in a small amount
  of Ethereum abandoned in the account.


5.1.3 Distribution Failures
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  In any payment system with many clients paying for product(s), and
  fees being distributed to various payees, there are normally many
  trusted partners involved, and many manual (or automated) processes
  that can fail.

  For example, what if a piece of software is created and distributed by
  some organization, and this software uses your licensed module?  If
  the organization fails, or is deplatformed by a hostile government or
  corporation, or the software is abandoned, then clients who find the
  software and install it and want to pay for a license will probably
  not be able to pay the organization for it – and your license fees
  also will go unpaid.

  Surely, there must be a way to deploy a sequence of interconnected
  Smart Contracts that can ensure that:

  • Any new client can uniquely allocate (and optionally store some data
    with) a "Forwarder" address and pay for the product,
  • Payment into that account address (and perhaps validation of its
    unique data) constitutes proof of licensing,
  • Payees (direct and indirect) can flush any such payments through to
    themselves (and others)

  These goals *can* be achieved using per-client "Forwarder" account
  addresses.


5.2 "Forwarder" Account Addresses
─────────────────────────────────

  The solution to this problem is to use accounts that *nobody* has
  "private key" access to – including you (the software issuer), or any
  client.

  These accounts host an Ethereum Smart Contract (the account address is
  actually the pre-computed address of a future instance of a
  "Forwarder" contract).  They are not Externally Owned Account (EOA)
  addresses, and have no Private Key; they can only do what their Smart
  Contract defines.

  The *only* function of these "Forwarder" Contracts is to collect the
  address' Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens into the product's "Fee
  Distribution" `MultiPayoutERC20' Contract account, optionally storing
  an immutable value associated with the "salt" value from which the
  "Forwarder" account address is derived.


5.2.1 The Client "Forwarder" Contract
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Once the product's `MultiPayoutERC20' "Fee Distribution" contract
  address is identified, the act of obtaining a unique client payee
  "Forwarder" address is simple.

  1) A "salt" value unique to the client is deduced, usually consisting
     of "something they know" (eg. a Public Key) plus "something they
     have" (eg. a Machine ID, or a User Name).
  2) The salt is used to deduce the client's unique "Forwarder" address


◊ 5.2.1.1 The Product Owner's MultiPayoutERC20 Contract

  The creation of a `MultiPayoutERC20' contract is very simple.

  The product owner must know the Ethereum addresses of the payees, and
  each payee's proportion of the product revenue.  A payee may be
  another MultiPayoutERC20 contract (eg. for a product module
  sub-license), which may in turn have its own payees.

  An Ethereum account containing sufficient funds to establish the
  MultiPayoutERC20 contract must be available.  Here's an example, using
  the Ethereum "Goerli" testnet.

  Since contract creation is expensive, we'll determine if we've already
  deployed a MultiPayoutERC20 contract, so we don't need to spend funds
  to executed this example.  We'll use any `GOERLI_SEED' or
  `GOERLI_XPRVKEY' defined in your environment, as well as
  `ALCHEMY_API_TOKEN' and `ETHERSCAN_API_TOKEN' available.

  First, lets get the Ethereum account private key details, and see if
  we've already deployed a MultiPayoutERC20:

5.2.2 Distributing Funds Deterministically
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  One (or more) Smart Contracts move the funds from this account, into
  the payees' accounts/Contracts.

  If multiple independent parties must be paid out of the proceeds from
  each client, receiving payments to a plain Account (for which you hold
  the private key) may not be acceptable to all parties involved.  A
  product owner providing a licensee the capability to sub-licensing
  their product may, for example, charge a much better fee, if the
  licensee can prove that payments will *automatically* flow back to the
  license owner, every time the licensee sells their product which
  contains the sub-license.

  There are ways to ensure that each client payment *must* be
  distributed to each payee, as agreed, using cryptocurrencies which
  implement Smart Contracts.

  A Smart Contract can be created which guarantees that Cryptocurrency
  funds from a source address are distributed in a fixed proportion to
  several destination addresses.

  A Contract is created that is unique to each set of payee accounts and
  (fractional) distribution of assets, containing a function something
  like this (in Solidity):
  ┌────
  │ function payout_internal() private nonReentrant {
  │     move_but_x10000_to(  9310, payable( address( 0x7F7458EF9A583B95DFD90C048d4B2d2F09f6dA5b ))); //   6.900%
  │     move_but_x10000_to(  5703, payable( address( 0x94Da50738E09e2f9EA0d4c15cf8DaDfb4CfC672B ))); //  40.000%
  │     move_but_x10000_to(     0, payable( address( 0xa29618aBa937D2B3eeAF8aBc0bc6877ACE0a1955 ))); //  53.100%
  │ }
  └────

  (you can see the remaining Smart Contract code in the [slip-39
  source].)

  This function can be executed in various ways.

5.2.4 Client "Forwarder" Account Creation and Licensing
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Guaranteeing that each client's payments always flow through to the
  designated tree of payees is the responsibility of the
  `MultiPayoutERC20Forwarder' (client "Forwarder" account) and
  `MultiPayoutERC20' (product's "Fee Distribution") Smart Contracts.

  Confirmation of Licensing is the responsibility of the client
  software.  At software runtime, some checks are completed.  At
  minimum, two pieces of data are loaded from storage:

  • The Machine ID, and
  • A Public Key and a Signature of the Machine ID (previously
    generated), or
  • A Private Key (from which the Machine ID Signature can be generated)

  Then, assuming:

  • Accounts can be created uniquely for some pseudo-random
    client-specific identifying key
    • A public key for example
  • Some data can be stored and later retrieved using that client key
    • The signature of some License text or the client-unique Machine ID
      (or a significant portion of it)
  • Payments to the account can be queried from on the blockchain

  The client software can check the blockchain to confirm payment to the
  account, and the saved data (eg. Signature) can be checked to confirm
  that this client is indeed the licensee.  For example, the client's
  Private Key generates the Public Key, and the retrieved signature
  matches the Sgnature of the Machine ID.

  If all of these tests pass, then the client software has confirmed
  that it is licensed.

  If not, a licensing offer (invoice) can be generated, to allow the
  client to obtain a license.


◊ 5.2.4.1 Licensing Attacks

  An attacker can attempt to re-use some pre-existing license payment;
  it can inspect the blockchain history to obtain the prior allocation
  of a paid "Forwarder" account, and recover the client key (the
  client's public key), and the associated data stored for that key (the
  signature).  However, when the software attempts to confirm that the
  public key signs the machine ID, it will fail, because the attacker
  doesn't have the original payee's machine ID – which was not included
  in the original blockchain transaction.

  Only if the client software is also under the control of the attacker
  can this attack succeed; but, in that case, the attacker can simply
  remove the entire license check from the software.


5.3 Single-Use Accounts using Pre-Signed Transfers
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  One tempting (but ultimately fragile) solution is to use Ethereum
  "transfer" transactions that you don't actually have the private key
  to sign.

  One artifact of how Ethereum (and similar) Cryptocurrency systems
  create and validate transactions, is that the "source" address may be
  deduced from the transaction and its accompanying signature.
  Normally, one already "has" a source address (and its private key)
  containing funds, and then creates a transaction moving some of those
  funds (or executing a Smart Contract call) to some destination, and
  finally signs it using their private key.  However, one *can* create
  the exact same transaction performing the same actions – and then
  *provide a random signature*, and deduce what Ethereum Account it
  *must* have originated from.  This will be a pseudo-random
  (unpredictable) source Address, assuming that some bit(s) in the
  transaction and/or signature differ.

  This "signed" transaction from this random Ethereum account may do
  anything – so long as (when it's finally executed) there is sufficient
  Ethereum available to pay the "Gas" fees, and to supply whatever value
  (in ETH, ERC-20 tokens, etc.) is required by the transaction.


5.3.1 Collection Failure
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  A number of failure modes exist that can result in cryptocurrency lost
  in this client address:

  • Only ETH supported at reasonable cost
  • If an ERC-20 token transfer is invoked, the exact token must be
    known in advance.
    • Any other token or Ethereum deposited would be lost
  • If the exact correct amount of Ethereum to pay for Gas is not
    deposited, the transaction will fail and will not be re-executable,
    resulting in loss of all funds at the address.


5.3.2 Not Supported for Bitcoin
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This idea is *not possible* using Bitcoin, due to its lack of
  general-purpose smart contracts, and the fact that one cannot "sign"
  transactions in advance to generate the "source" Account address: the
  transaction must contain specific information about the source UTXOs
  (Unspent TransaXion Outputs) being spent, which is of course
  unavailable in advance.


5.4 Testing `MultiPayoutERC20'
──────────────────────────────

  Put some TGOR (Test Goerli Ethereum) tokens into the "zoo zoo … wrong"
  Ethereum account on the Goerli testnet.  This is (of course) a
  well-known account, and the funds will disappear pretty quickly, but
  should give you time to run the tests successfully.

  You can mint TGOR for free, at:
  ┌────

6 Building & Installing
═══════════════════════

  If you `git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git' and have
  the source code, you can use the supplied GNU `make' targets to create
  a venv Virtual Environment and build then install.

  The GUI requires Python3 with `tk' support, and uses PySimpleGUI which
  has a 30-day trial period, after which it requires a license.


6.1 Homebrew on macOS, or Nix on Linux or macOS
───────────────────────────────────────────────

  The `python-slip39' project is tested under both homebrew:
  ┌────
  │ $ brew install python-tk@3.12
  │ $ PY3=python3.12 make venv
  │ ...
  │ (python-slip39-13.0.0-usr-darwin-cpython-312) bash-3.2$
  └────

  and using [the official python.org/downloads installer].

  It is also supported under Nix (optionally prefixed with
  eg. `TARGET\=py310'):
  ┌────
  │ $ make nix-venv
  │ ...
  │ *** Activating /Users/perry/src/python-slip39-13.0.0-nix-darwin-cpython-312 VirtualEnv for Interactive /bin/bash
  │ (python-slip39-13.0.0-nix-darwin-cpython-312) Perrys-MBP:python-slip39 perry$
  └────

  The Nix installation is probably the recommended approach for macOS
  and Linux.

  Either of these methods will get you a `python3' executable running
  version 3.12+, usable for running the `slip39' module, and the
  `slip39.gui' GUI.


[the official python.org/downloads installer]
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>


6.2 Native Python3 on Linux
───────────────────────────

  To manually create your own venv and install from pypi using the
  Python 3.9 to 3.12 (+ TK if using the GUI) you have at hand:

  1) Ensure your Python3 has `tk' and `pip', and GNU `make'; on Linux
     systems, this might be something like:
     ┌────
     │ $ sudo apt install make python3-pip python3-tk
     └────

  2) Create the Python3 Virtual Environment using the GNU `make' target
     `venv'; this will create the venv, and install `slip39' in it:
     ┌────
     │ $ cd python-slip39
     │ $ make venv
     │ $ python3 -m slip39.gui
     └────

     To create it manually, and then install `slip39', go into the
     `python-slip39' directory you cloned, and:
     ┌────
     │ $ python3 -m venv python-slip39-venv
     │ $ . ./python-slip39-venv/bin/activate
     │ (python-slip39-venv) [you@yourhost src]$ python3 -m pip install slip39[gui]
     │ ...
     │ (python-slip39-venv) [you@yourhost src]$ python3 -m slip39.gui
     └────
  3) The GUI is built using PySimpleGUI, which has a 30-day trial period
     before you have to purchase a license.  Accept the trial period,
     and the GUI will be displayed.


6.3 The `slip39' Module
───────────────────────

  To build the wheel and install `slip39' manually:
  ┌────
  │ $ git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git
  │ $ make -C python-slip39 install
  └────


  To install from Pypi, including the optional requirements to run the
  PySimpleGUI/tkinter GUI, support serial I/O, and to support creating
  encrypted BIP-38 and Ethereum JSON Paper Wallets:
  ┌────
  │ $ python3 -m pip install slip39[gui,wallet,serial]
  └────


6.4 The `slip39' GUI
────────────────────

  To install from Pypi, including the optional requirements to run the
  PySimpleGUI/tkinter GUI:
  ┌────
  │ $ python3 -m pip install slip39[gui]
  └────


  Then, there are several ways to run the GUI:
  ┌────
  │ $ python3 -m slip39.gui     # Execute the python slip39.gui module main method
  │ $ slip39-gui                # Run the main function provided by the slip39.gui module
  └────


6.4.1 The macOS/win32 `SLIP-39.app' GUI
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  You can build the native macOS and win32 `SLIP-39.app' App.

  This requires the official [python.org/downloads] installer; the
  homebrew python-tk@3.9 will not work for building the native app using
  either `PyInstaller'. (The `py2app' approach doesn't work in either
  version of Python).

  ┌────
  │ $ git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git
  │ $ make -C python-slip39 app
  └────

6.4.2 The Windows 10 `SLIP-39' GUI
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Install Python from <https://python.org/downloads>, and the [Microsoft
  C++ Build Tools] via the Visual Studio Installer (required for
  installing some `slip39' package dependencies).

  To run the GUI, just install `slip39' package from Pypi using pip,
  including the `gui' and `wallet' options.  Building the Windows
  `SLIP-39' executable GUI application requires the `dev' option.
  ┌────
  │ PS C:\Users\IEUser> pip install slip39[gui,wallet,dev]
  └────


  To work with the [python-slip39 Git repo on Github], you'll also need
  to install [Git from git-scm.com]. Once installed, run "Git bash", and
  ┌────
  │ $ ssh-keygen.exe -t ed25519
  └────

  to create an `id_ed25519.pub' SSH identity, and import it into your
  Git Settings SSH keys.  Then,
  ┌────
  │ $ mkdir src
  │ $ cd src
  │ $ git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git
  └────

7 Licensing
═══════════

  Each installation of the SLIP-39 App requires an Ed25519 "Agent"
  identity, and cryptographically signed license(s) to activate various
  python-slip39 features.  No license is required to use basic features;
  advanced features require a license.


7.1 Create an Ed25519 "Agent" Key
─────────────────────────────────

  The Ed25519 signing "Agent" identity is loaded at start-up, and (if
  necessary) is created automatically on first execution.  This is
  similar to the `ssh-keygen -t ed25519' procedure.

  Each separate installation must have a
  ~/.crypto-licensing/python-slip39.crypto-keypair.  This contains the
  licensing "Agent" credentials: a passphrase-encrypted Ed25519 private
  key, and a self-signed public key.  This shows that we actually had
  access to the private key and used it to create a signature for the
  claimed public key and the supplied encrypted private key – proving
  that the public key is valid, and associated with the encrypted
  private key.


7.2 Validating an Advanced Feature License
──────────────────────────────────────────

  When an advanced feature is used, all available
  `python-slip39.crypto-license' files are loaded.  They are examined,
  and if a license is found that is:

  • Assigned to this Agent and Machine-ID
  • Contains the required license authorizations

  then the functionality is allowed to proceed.

  If no license is found, instructions on how to obtain a license for
  this Agent on this Machine-ID will be displayed.

  If you've already obtained a "master" license on your primary
  machine's SLIP-39 installation, you can use it to issue a sub-license
  to this installation (eg. for your air-gapped cryptocurrency
  management machine).

  Otherwise, a URL is displayed at which the required "master" license
  can be issued.


7.2.1 Get a sub-license From Your "master" License
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Typically, you'll be using python-slip39's advanced features on an
  air-gapped computer.  You do not want to visit websites from this
  computer.  So, you obtain a sub-license from your primary computer's
  python-slip39 installation, and place it on your secure air-gapped
  computer (eg. using a USB stick).

  Take note of the secondary machine's Agent ID (pubkey) and Machine ID.
  On your primary computer (with the "master" license), run:
  ┌────
  │ python3 -m slip39.sublicense <agent-pubkey> <machine-id>
  └────


  Take the output, and place it in the file
  `~/.crypto-licensing/python-slip39.crypto-license' on your air-gapped
  computer.


7.2.2 Obtaining an Advanced Feature "master" License
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  On your primary computer, open the provided URL in a browser.  The URL
  contains the details of the advanced feature desired.

  This URL's web page will request an Ed25519 "Agent" public key to
  issue your "master" license to.  This should be your primary user
  account's Ed25519 "Agent" public key – this master "Agent" will be
  issuing sub-licenses to any of your other SLIP-39 installations.  You
  will be redirected to a URL that is unique to the advanced feature
  plus your Agent ID.

  An invoice will be generated with unique Bitcoin, Ethereum and perhaps
  other cryptocurrency addresses.  Pay the required amount of
  cryptocurrency to one of the provided wallet addresses.  Within a few
  seconds, the cryptocurrency transfer will be confirmed.

  Once the payment for the advanced feature is confirmed, the URL
  including your agent ID will always allow you to re-download the
  license.  It is only usable by your Agent ID to issue sub-licenses to
  your python-slip39 installations on your machines.
