SLIP-39 Mnemonics can be used directly on a Trezor to backup/restore the
Seed.

Also supports other Hardware Wallets that require a BIP-39 Mnemonic for
Seed recovery, such as to your Ledger Nano.  Recover your BIP-39 Seed
Phrase from these SLIP-39 cards using the GUI (or command-line, or
<https://iancoleman.io/slip39/>) whenever you need it, to restore your
Crypto accounts to your hardware wallet.

1 Using BIP-39
══════════════

  To support older or less expensive existing hardware wallets that
  *only* support BIP-39 recovery, *or* to backup existing BIP-39
  Mnemonic phrases to SLIP-39 (to avoid moving all of your old BIP-39
  Seed derived wallets to new SLIP-39 Seed derived wallets), click the
  "Using BIP-39" checkbox (this is the default). This will do two
  things:


1.1 Output BIP-39 Mnemonics
───────────────────────────

  You will see your BIP-39 Mnemonic, which encodes the Seed Source (and
  optionally any Seed Extra Randomness) you've specified.

  We'll even include one BIP-39 card in the output PDF.  You can store
  this card (very safely and securely), but we recommend you destroy it,
  and instead use the SLIP-39 App with your SLIP-39 Mnemonic Cards to
  recover the BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase when needed.


1.2 Use BIP-39 Seed Generation
──────────────────────────────

  Any Cryptocurrency wallet QR codes and Paper Wallets will be derived
  using standard BIP-39 Seed generation.

  Since BIP-39 uses the Seed Entropy *differently* than SLIP-39 does,
  this produces *different* wallets in the hardware wallet device!  In
  other words, exactly the same 128- or 256-bit entropy produces
  different wallets in a [Trezor Safe 3] recovered directly from SLIP-39
  Mnemonics, compared to the same Trezor or [Ledger Nano X] recovered
  from BIP-39.

  This is usually not a problem: just ensure that if you're intending to
  use a hardware wallet that natively supports SLIP-39 (like the
  Trezor), *do not select* "Using BIP-39".  Then, the QR codes and Paper
  Wallets printed will match those produced in the hardware wallet after
  SLIP-39 recovery.

  If your hardware wallet only supports BIP-39 (or you're just backing
  up the Seed Entropy of an existing BIP-39 Mnemonic using SLIP-39, and
  you want to continue using the original BIP-39 wallets), then *do
  select* "Using BIP-39".  Then, when you recover your Trezor or Ledger
  from BIP-39, the printed QR codes and Paper Wallets will use the
  BIP-39 Seed generation standard, and will match those produced in the
  hardware after BIP-39 recovery.
