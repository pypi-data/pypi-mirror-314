Name each Group according to "who" or "where" you plan to distribute it.

The default Group names and their intended usages are:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 First   A 1-card group stored in the First safe place 
 Second  A 1-card group stored in the First safe place 
 Fam     A smaller group of Family members             
 Fren    A larger group of Friends; increase Needed    
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


1 1-Card Groups
═══════════════

  Useful for the direct owners of the Seed.  Just one Card for these
  groups must be collected; ensure that 2+ of these Groups are created,
  and a "Requires recovery" threshold of least 2 is specified.

  If /less than/ the threshold amount of these cards is found by an
  attacker, the Seed /cannot/ be recovered (unless other Groups are also
  recovered).


2 Multi-Card Groups
═══════════════════

  If you have a group of people (or places) that may be lost or
  destroyed, or where some Mnemonics (cards) may be found and fall into
  hostile hands, use a multi-card group.


2.1 Hostile Groups
──────────────────

  The more /hostile/ (untrustworthy) the group (ie. the more likely that
  any card(s) may be stolen by an attacker) – make the Group's
  Needed/#-in-Group ratio larger.  Then, the attacker must collect more
  cards to defeat the Group.


2.2 Fragile Groups
──────────────────

  The more /fragile/ (unreliable) the group (ie. the more likely that
  any card(s) may be lost or destroyed) – make the Group's
  Needed/#-in-Group ratio smaller.  Thus, more cards may be
  lost/destroyed before the Group can no longer be recovered (an *other*
  Group(s) must be colledted, instead, to recover the Seed).
