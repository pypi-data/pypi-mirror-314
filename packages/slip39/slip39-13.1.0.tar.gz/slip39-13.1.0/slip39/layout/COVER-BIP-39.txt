                       SEED RECOVERY USING BIP-39
                      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


SLIP-39 supports Hardware Wallets that require BIP-39 Mnemonics for Seed
recovery, such as your Ledger Nano, etc.  Recover your BIP-39 Mnemonic
phrase from these cards using the SLIP-39 App whenever you need it, to
restore your Cryptocurrency accounts to your hardware wallet.

• Open the SLIP-39 App, and set Controls to "Recover"
• In "Seed Source", use "SLIP-39" and input Mnemonics, with sufficient:
  • Different Groups to satisfy Recovery Card Groups threshold
  • Cards in each Group to meet each groups' recovery minimums
• In "Seed & SLIP-39 Recover Groups", click "Using BIP-39"
  • The BIP-39 Mnemonic will be recovered and displayed
• Restore your Cryptocurrency accounts to your hardware wallet by
  entering the BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase.
• Cut off and *destroy* this BIP-39 Mnemonic backup, once you are
  confident you can recover it at will!

      NOTE: You cannot enter these SLIP-39 Mnemonics directly on a
      BIP-39 Hardware Wallet to recover the Seed.  Use the SLIP-39
      App to recover the BIP-39 Seed Phrase.
