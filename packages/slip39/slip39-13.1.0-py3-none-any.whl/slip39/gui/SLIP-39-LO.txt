1 Backup
════════

  The simplest mode, to "back up" a BIP-39 Seed Phrase Mnemonic to
  SLIP-39 Mnemonic Card Groups.

  Once you print, test recovery and distribute the SLIP-39 Mnemonic
  Cards, you can safely destroy your unreliable and insecure BIP-39 Seed
  Phrase Mnemonic backups; you can securely and reliably recover your
  BIP-39 Seed Phrase whenever you need it, by collecting a sufficient
  number of the SLIP-39 Cards.


2 Create
════════

  A basic SLIP-39 Mnemonic creation interface.  Default support for
  [Trezor Safe 3] with native SLIP-39 Mnemonics recovery.

  Select "Using BIP-39" for a traditional BIP-39 Seed Phrase Mnemonic,
  to use any other hardware wallets such as the [Ledger Nano] (or even
  the Trezor, in BIP-39 Recovery mode).

3 Recovery
══════════

  Greater control over the Mnemonic creation process.  Recovery of Seed
  Entropy from SLIP-39 Mnemonics.

  Recover Seed Entropy from existing BIP-39 Mnemonic phrases by
  selecting "BIP-39 Entropy" in Seed Source.


3.1 Extra Seed Randomness
─────────────────────────

  Probably most importantly, Extra Seed Entropy can be supplied.  Any
  data supplied (Dice rolls, for example, add about 2.5 bits of entropy
  per roll) is hashed with a standard SHA-512 hash function, which can
  be independently confirmed.

  Finally, you can visually confirm that the Entropy is correctly
  applied via XOR to the Seed Data Source, to produce the Master Secret
  Seed.

  At no point do you need to "Trust" that the SLIP-39 program is
  producing a Master Secret Seed from known data!


3.2 SLIP-39
───────────

  Supports input of existing SLIP-39 mnemonics to recover the original
  Seed Entropy.


3.2.1 Recover From Lost SLIP-39 Mnemonic Cards
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  If you know that some of your original SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards have
  been lost, you can re-issue /another/ set of SLIP-39 cards containing
  the same, original Seed Entropy.


4 Pro
═════

  Advanced SLIP-39 creation and recovery, and recovery (and conversion)
  of BIP-39 Mnemonics to SLIP-39.

  Requires licensing.


4.1 BIP-39
──────────

  Conversion of existing, fragile BIP-39 12- or 24-word Mnemonic phrases
  into SLIP-39 is supported.

  Enter the BIP-39 recover phrase to recover the original 128- or
  256-bit Seed Entropy, and generate SLIP-39 Mnemonics which will
  recover the same Seed Entropy as the original 12- or 24-word BIP-39
  Mnemonic.
