Supply a password to produce an encrypted Ethereum JSON wallet or
Bitcoin, … BIP-38 Paper Wallet.

If you import these SLIP-39 Mnemonics directly into your Trezor hardware
wallet – you do /not/ need Paper Wallets: you have access to /all/ of
the wallets, in every cryptocurrency supported by the Trezor.

These are intended to support the importing of /individual/, single
wallets into standard software wallets (eg. Brave browser, Metamask
plugins, other software wallets on PCs or mobile devices).  If you need
some cryptocurrency "walking around" money, use them to create
recoverable "Safe Portable Crypto Accounts" (below).


1 Password
══════════

  If you lose or forget this Paper Wallet password – you cannot import
  these wallets into compatible software Cryptocurrency wallets!
  Remember; the Seed can still be recovered by collecting sufficient
  numbers of Mnemonics (cards), and then new Paper Wallets can be
  issued.


1.1 Hint
────────

  A small (<10 character) hint about what (or where) the Paper Wallet
  Password is.


2 Safe Portable Crypto Accounts
═══════════════════════════════

  If you want to issue temporary Paper Wallets (to carry cryptocurrency
  with you to give to someone or buy something), then Paper Wallets
  derived from your account are a good idea.


2.1 Custom Derivation Path
──────────────────────────

  Use the `SLIP-39' App to recover your Seed, select the desired
  Cryptocurrency (eg. `BTC'), and then enter a Paper Wallet Password,
  and a derivation path "suffix" into the "# to Derive" field,
  eg. "/1'/0/0-2".

  For example, if you use the BIP-39 recovery "test" Mnemonic "zoo zoo
  zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo wrong", with the above "# to
  Derive", this would result in 3 paper wallets being produced, at the
  following standard BTC Bech32 derivation paths:

   m/84'/0'/1'/0/0  bc1qg9s8qzm0lcetfv6umhlm3evtca5zsqv7elqd5s 
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  You could load these wallets with funds, write the amount on the
  front, and fold them over twice (to hide the PRIVATE KEY, while
  leaving the PUBLIC ADDRESS exposed), and even laminate them to avoid
  accidental discovery or exposure to moisture.

  Then, once loaded, they can always be *recovered* by you (if they are
  lost or accidentally destroyed).  Otherwise, the intended recipient
  can unfold the Paper Wallet, and move the funds to their own wallet.
