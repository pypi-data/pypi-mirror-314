This library allows you to simply define DAG-workflows in Python where artefacts are stored on a filesystem.

Fsdag aims at simple personal or group projects, where no dependencies and simplicity are paramount.
It is implemented in less than 100 lines of code.

* [pydags],
* [hamilton],
* [luigi],
* ... and many others on: https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline

## Approach

You simply define nodes of your workflow, and execute them lazily.
Each node corresponds to an artefact.
If the artefact already exists on the filesystem, it will be loaded; otherwise, it will be computed.
Once loaded or computed, the artefacts are kept in memory for further access.

## Installation

To install fsdag, simply run the following command in your virtual environment:
```
pip3 install fsdag
```

## Usage

The workflow node is implemented as an abstract class `fsdag.Node`.
For your concrete nodes, you have to implement the following methods:
* `_path`: where the artefact should be stored on disk,
* `_save`: how to store the artefact to `_path()`,
* `_load`: how to load the artefact from `_path()`, and
* `_compute`: how to compute the artefact.

To resolve the node, call `resolve()`.

## Examples

### Basic Example

Here is an example showing how you can model a node where the data is de/serialized using JSON.

```python
import json
import pathlib
from typing import List

import fsdag

class Something(fsdag.Node[List[int]]):
    def _path(self) -> pathlib.Path:
        return pathlib.Path("/some/path/something.json")

    def _save(self, artefact: List[int]) -> None:
        self._path().write_text(json.dumps(artefact))

    def _load(self) -> List[int]:
        return json.loads(
            self._path().read_text()
        )  # type: ignore

    def _compute(self) -> List[int]:
        return [1, 2, 3]

something = Something()
print(something.resolve())
# Outputs: [1, 2, 3]
# The artefact is now saved to the filesystem. It is also kept
# in memory # for faster access if you ever resolve it again.

# For example, calling ``resolve`` here again retrieves
# the artefact from the memory cache:
print(something.resolve())
# Outputs: [1, 2, 3]

another_something = Something()
# This call to the ``resolve`` method will not perform
# the computation, but load the artefact from the filesystem.
print(another_something.resolve())
# Outputs: [1, 2, 3]
```

### `None` Artefact

Some tasks contain no artefact, *i.e.*, they are mere procedures which should be executed, but return nothing.
To model such procedures, use `None` as the generic parameter and a marker file:

```python
import pathlib

import fsdag

class Something(fsdag.Node[None]):
    def _path(self) -> pathlib.Path:
        return pathlib.Path("/path/to/somewhere/done")

    def _save(self, artefact: None) -> None:
        self._path().write_text("done")

    def _load(self) -> None:
        return

    def _compute(self) -> None:
        # Perform some complex procedure.
        ...
        return

something = Something()
# The procedure is executed here once.
something.resolve()

another_something = Something()
# This resolution does nothing as the procedure 
# has been already executed.
another_something.resolve()
```

### Workflow Graph

Here is a full example of a simple workflow graph.

```python
import json
import pathlib

import fsdag

class Something(fsdag.Node[int]):
    def _path(self) -> pathlib.Path:
        return pathlib.Path("/some/path/something.json")

    def _save(self, artefact: int) -> None:
        self._path().write_text(json.dumps(artefact))

    def _load(self) -> int:
        return json.loads(
            self._path().read_text()
        )  # type: ignore

    def _compute(self) -> int:
        return 1


class Another(fsdag.Node[int]):
    def _path(self) -> pathlib.Path:
        return pathlib.Path("/some/path/another.json")

    def _save(self, artefact: int) -> None:
        self._path().write_text(json.dumps(artefact))

    def _load(self) -> int:
        return json.loads(
            self._path().read_text()
        )  # type: ignore

    def _compute(self) -> int:
        return 2

class Sum(fsdag.Node[int]):
    def __init__(
            self, 
            something: Something, 
            another: Another
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.something = something
        self.another = another
    
    def _path(self) -> pathlib.Path:
        return pathlib.Path("/some/path/sum.json")

    def _save(self, artefact: int) -> None:
        self._path().write_text(json.dumps(artefact))

    def _load(self) -> int:
        return json.loads(
            self._path().read_text()
        )  # type: ignore

    def _compute(self) -> int:
        # Note the calls to ``resolve`` methods here.
        return (
            self.something.resolve() 
            + self.another.resolve()
        )

something = Something()
another = Another()

result = Sum(something=something, another=another)

# The call to ``result.resolve`` will recursively and 
# lazily resolve the ``something`` and ``another``.
print(result.resolve())
# Outputs: 3
```
