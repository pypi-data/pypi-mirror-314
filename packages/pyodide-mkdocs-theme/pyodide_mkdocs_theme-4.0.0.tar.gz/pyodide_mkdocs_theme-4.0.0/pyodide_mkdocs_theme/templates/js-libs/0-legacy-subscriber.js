This module is loaded as "text/javascript", for backward compatibility, providing globals to
avoid failure of old codes.

Purposes/notes:

  - hooks files using subscribeWhenReady

  - MathJax replacements through custom_dir override. Note that, in addition to keep backward
    compatibility, loading mathjax-libs.js in a synch way also simplifies A LOT getting everything
    right at load time (because the mathjax cdn is loaded sync...)

  - The functions defined here are available in the global scope, but won't override the ones
    defined in the modules: those are explicitly imported where needed, in the modules.
    On the other hand, jsLogger becomes unusable in non modules...

  - The modules will override this globals with their own once they are loaded

/**Auto-subscription routine to document changes.
 * If the subscription is not possible yet (readyForSubscription[waitOn] is falsy), try again
 * @delay later until it works.
 *
 * @waitId :  Property to observe in readyForSubscription global object.Also used as subscription
 *            identifier.
 * @callback: Routine to run when the document changes
 * @options : An object with optional fields:
 *      .delay (=50): Time interval (in ms) to wait in between two subscription attempts.
 *      .now (=false): If true, ignore the CONFIG.subscriptionReady property and subscribe at call
 *              time. If false, a callback will be returned by the `subscribeWhenReady` function,
 *              that the caller can use to signal when the subscription is ready.
 *      .waitFor (=null): If given, it must be a boolean provider or a jquery identifier string,
 *              which will result in a function checking for the existence of that element in
 *              the DOM. This function will be called every .delay ms and the subscription will
 *              be delayed until it returns true. This has precedence over the .now option.
 *      .runOnly: if truthy, run the callback when ready, but do not subscribe to document changes.
 *      .maxTries: if not given 20 tries allowed.
 *
 * @throws: Error if maxTries subscriptions attempts are done without success.
