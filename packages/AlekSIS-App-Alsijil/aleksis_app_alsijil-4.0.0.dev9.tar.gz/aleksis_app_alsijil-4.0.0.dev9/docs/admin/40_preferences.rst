System-wide settings for the digital class register
===================================================

The behaviour of the digital class register  can be customised
under `Admin → Configuration → Class Register`. The section contains the
following preferences:

* **Block adding personal notes for cancelled lessons**: If this option is
  activated, teachers will not be able to add personal notes for cancelled
  lessons.
* **Allow users to view their own personal notes:** With this option, the school management
  can control whether students should be able to view their own personal notes.
* **Allow primary group owners to register future absences for students in their groups**:
  This allows owners of the student's primary group (e. g. the class)
  to register future absences like doctor's appointments or family celebrations.
* **Grant the owner of a parent group the same privileges as the owners of the respective child groups**:
  The owner of a group can perform all operations on child groups and related objects an owner of
  the respected child groups is allowed to (e. g. editing the lesson documentation).
* **Allow original teachers to edit their lessons although they are substituted:**
  In the case of substitute teaching, absent teachers can be given write-in privileges for the lesson.
* **Carry over data from first lesson period to the following lesson periods in lessons over multiple periods:**
  For double (or even more adjacent) lessons, the lesson data from the first lesson period
  can be automatically carried over to the following lessons.
* **Carry over personal notes to all following lesson periods on the same day:**
  For double (or more adjacent) lessons, the personal notes from the first lesson period
  can be automatically carried over to the following lessons.
* **Allow teachers to open lesson periods on the same day and not just at the beginning of the period:**
  Teachers can open lessons earlier on the same day and not just at the beginning of the lesson.
* **Allow teachers to add data for lessons in holidays:**
  It is possible to allow entering content for lessons during the holidays.
* **Allow group owners to assign group roles to the parents of the group's members:**
  With this being activated, group roles like parent representatives can be managed by the class teacher.
