Defining base data
==================

With sufficient authorisation, two additional menu items appear in the class register menu.

Excuse types
------------

Additional types of excuse for an absence can be created here.
This can be useful if you only want to count certain absences.
For example, if a student is busy at a school event and misses lessons,
this may not be counted as a normal absence.

Extra marks
-----------

Some remarks are repeated over and over again, such as 'Forgot homework'.
In order not to have to write this again and again in the remark field,
additional marks can be set, which then only have to be clicked on in the class register.

Group roles
-----------

To track special roles in groups in the class register, group roles
like class representatives or ventilation services can be defined here.

Group roles can be managed via menu entry "Manage group roles" located in
the submenu "Class register".
