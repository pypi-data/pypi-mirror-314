(Archive) printout
==================

Via the menu item *My Groups*, extensive documentation can be generated for each group.
This class register will be generated as a printable PDF file.

It contains a list of the lessons taught staggered according to timetable periods,
a collection of all the students' personal notes as well as all lesson contents.

An alternative path to printing a class register is via the weekly view.
There, the relevant group can be selected via the filter to print the class book.

.. note::
   This mechanism can be used for archival purposes required by law.
