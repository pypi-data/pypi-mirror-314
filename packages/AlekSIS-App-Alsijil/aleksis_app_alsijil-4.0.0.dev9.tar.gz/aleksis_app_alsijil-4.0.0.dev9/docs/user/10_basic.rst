Concept of Alsijil and overview about functionality
===================================================

AlekSIS provides a privacy-compliant online class register solution.
It is not simply the digital equivalent of a paper class book, although elements are adopted
for easier orientation and smoother transition for teachers. For example, there is a weekly
view of all lessons and a list of all the students in the class. Lesson content,
notes about the student and also remarks about the learning group can be entered.

However, the application uses the possibilities and therefore the advantages of a digital application.
The student lists do not have to be filled in by the class teacher,
but are provided automatically by the system. The timetable is also already stored.

In addition, statistical evaluation, like counting absences, is done
automatically.

In an overview, Alsijil currently provides the following functionality:

- Direct link to the lesson currently taking place
- Overview with all lessons of one week
    + Navigation between lessons
    + Filtering according to learning groups/courses and teachers
- List of learning groups
    + List of students with current statistics (absences, lateness, etc.)
    + printing of the group-specific class register
- "My overview" for pupils with an overview of "personal notes" such as omissions, lateness, remarks
- "My overview" for teachers with a list of their own lessons over the last four weeks and the following filtering options:
    + Specifying the period
    + Restriction to lessons with or without entry for lesson content
    + Restriction to certain groups
    + Restriction to certain lesson contents
