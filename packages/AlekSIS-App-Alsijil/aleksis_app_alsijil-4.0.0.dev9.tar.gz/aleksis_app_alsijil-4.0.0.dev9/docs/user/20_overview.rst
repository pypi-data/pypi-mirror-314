Week overview

In the weekly overview, all lessons of the week for the respective user are displayed in a weekly schedule.
Clicking on a lesson takes you to the data for that lesson.
Above the schedule, you can navigate to the previous or following week.
It is also possible to filter the schedule according to certain groups or teachers.

My overview
-----------

Personal overview for students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This menu item provides the student with an overview of the personal notes
such as tardiness, absences and remarks that teachers have entered in the class register.
This enables them to quickly check whether excuses still need to be submitted,
and to verify what notes have been made about them.

Personal overview for teachers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For teachers, this view shows their own lessons for the last four weeks.
A filter can be used to adjust the list with regard to period,
missing entries, certain groups or certain lesson contents.
A corresponding symbol in each line immediately shows
whether entries are still missing for the lesson in question.
Individual lessons can be called up from the list to add or change entries.

You are also able to create custom excuse types via the menu entry "Excuse
types". These custom types are also shown in the statistical overview. The
custom excuse types are also shown in the legend under the students overview
table.


All lessons
-----------

For the head teacher or the coordinators of certain grades,
this menu item gives the possibility to see all lessons of a learning group in a list.
By means of a filter, the list can be specified to certain entries.
This makes it possible to call up all lessons with missing entries and
to send a request for completion of the data to the teachers concerned via a button.
