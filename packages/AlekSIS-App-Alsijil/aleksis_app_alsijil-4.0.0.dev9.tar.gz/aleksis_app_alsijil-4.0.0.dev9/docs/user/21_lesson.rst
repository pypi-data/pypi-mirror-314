Viewing and managing lessons
============================

The lesson documentation can be called up in different ways:

1. **Via 'Current lesson'**: During the current lesson, this is the quickest way to access the lesson documentation.
2. **Via 'Weekly overview'**: This menu item shows all lessons of the current week. Individual lessons can be clicked on to access the lesson documentation.
3. **'My Overview'**: This menu item shows teachers a list of all hours worked in the last weeks. Individual lessons can be called up directly.

The lesson documentation consists of four main parts accessible via tabs.
The data can be entered, changed and saved via the relevant forms.
In addition, navigation to the previous or next lesson is possible.


Tab 'Lesson Documentation'
--------------------------

The lesson documentation is a strictly non-personal information about the contents
of the lesson. It contains the topic, describing what contents were taught, and an
optional homework, describing what tasks students got for the next lesson.

Everything entered here should be considered public knowledge.

.. warning::
   Never add any personal information to the lesson documentation.

If enabled in the preferences, lesson documentation is carried over to adjacent
lessons. So if one subject is held in a double or triple lesson, only one needs
to be filled in.

Tab 'Personal Notes'
--------------------

Personal notes are specific to single students, and contain information about
absences, tardiness, any extra marks defined in the system, and a free text comment.

This information can never be viewed by other students. It is visible to any
teacher in the class by default, and might also be visible to the concerned
student.

Behaviour of absences and tardiness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a student is marked as absent, this information is carried over to all future
lessons on the same day, meaning that for any teacher holding lessons in the class
after the one that marked them as absent will automatically see them as absent.

Likewise, if a student returns and is marked as not absent, this is carried over
to all future lessons.

Tab 'Previous lesson'
---------------------

This tab shows information about the previous lesson in the same group and subject
for reference.

Tab 'More'
----------

This tab contains several special items not mentioned before:

* **Changes**: Alsijil tracks all changes made to class register entries. This list shows a log of all these changes.
