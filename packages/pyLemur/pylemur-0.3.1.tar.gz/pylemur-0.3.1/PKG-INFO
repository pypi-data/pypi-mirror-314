```bash
pip install pyLemur
```

Alternatively, install the latest development version directly from Github:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/const-ae/pyLemur.git@main
```

## Documentation

For more information on the functions see the [API docs](https://pyLemur.readthedocs.io/page/api.html) and the [tutorial](https://pylemur.readthedocs.io/page/notebooks/Tutorial.html).
