    """Dictionary where keys may be containers
    More specifically the underlying dict can have keys which supports
    the `in` operator on the actual key type.
    E.g.
    d = ContainerDict({1: 'one',

                       range(3,10), 'others'

    Beware that if multiple containers contain a key then the first matching
    container's value will be returned by __getitem__ for that key, and which
    one is "first" is unpredictable.

    There is also an optional "default" attribute returned if no match is found.
