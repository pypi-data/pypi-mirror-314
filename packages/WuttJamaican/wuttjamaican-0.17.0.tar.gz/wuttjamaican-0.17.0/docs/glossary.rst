   :sorted:

   ad hoc script
     Python script (text) file used for ad-hoc automation etc.  See
     also :doc:`narr/cli/scripts`.

   app
     Depending on context, may refer to the software application
     overall, or the :term:`app name`, or the :term:`app handler`.

   app database
     The main :term:`database` used by the :term:`app`.  There is
     normally just one database (for simple apps) which uses
     PostgreSQL for the backend.  The app database contains the
     :term:`settings table`.

   app dir
     Folder containing app-specific config files, log files, etc.
     Usually this is named ``app`` and is located at the root of the
     virtual environment.

     Can be retrieved via
     :meth:`~wuttjamaican.app.AppHandler.get_appdir()`.

   app enum
      Python module whose namespace contains all the "enum" values
      used by the :term:`app`.  Available on the :term:`app handler`
      as :attr:`~wuttjamaican.app.AppHandler.enum`.

   app handler
     Python object representing the core :term:`handler` for the
     :term:`app`.  There is normally just one "global" app handler;
     see also :doc:`narr/handlers/app`.

   app model
      Python module whose namespace contains all the :term:`data
      models<data model>` used by the :term:`app`.

   app name
     This refers to the canonical name for the underlying app/config
     system.  It does not refer to the overall app; contrast with
     :term:`app title`.

     In most cases (i.e. by default) this will simply be ``wutta``.
     This value affects the naming conventions for config files as
     well as setting names etc.

     The primary reason for this abstraction is so that the Rattail
     Project could leverage the Wutta config logic without having to
     rewrite all config files in the wild.

     See also :attr:`~wuttjamaican.conf.WuttaConfig.appname`.

   app provider
     A :term:`provider` which pertains to the :term:`app handler`.
     See :doc:`narr/providers/app`.

   app title
     Human-friendly name for the :term:`app` (e.g. "Wutta Poser").

     See also the :term:`app name` which serves a very different
     purpose.

   auth handler
      A :term:`handler` responsible for user authentication and
      authorization (login, permissions) and related things.

      See also :class:`~wuttjamaican.auth.AuthHandler`.

   command
     A top-level command line interface for the app.  Note that
     top-level commands don't usually "do" anything per se, and are
     mostly a way to group :term:`subcommands<subcommand>`.  See also
     :doc:`narr/cli/index`.

   config
     Depending on context, may refer to any of: :term:`config file`,
     :term:`config object`, :term:`config setting`.  See also
     :doc:`narr/config/index`.

   config extension
      A registered extension for the :term:`config object`.  What
      happens is, a config object is created and then extended by each
      of the registered config extensions.

      The intention is that all config extensions will have been
      applied before the :term:`app handler` is created.

   config file
     A file which contains :term:`config settings<config setting>`.
     See also :doc:`narr/config/files`.

   config object
     Python object representing the full set of :term:`config
     settings<config setting>` for the :term:`app`.  Usually it gets
     some of the settings from :term:`config files<config file>`, but
     it may also get some from the :term:`settings table`.  See also
     :doc:`narr/config/object`.

   config setting
     The value of a setting as obtained from a :term:`config object`.
     Depending on context, sometimes this refers specifically to
     values obtained from the :term:`settings table` as opposed to
     :term:`config file`.  See also :doc:`narr/config/settings`.

   data model
     Usually, a Python class which maps to a :term:`database` table.

   database
     Generally refers to a relational database which may be queried
     using SQL.  More specifically, one supported by `SQLAlchemy`_.

     .. _SQLAlchemy: https://www.sqlalchemy.org

     Most :term:`apps<app>` will have at least one :term:`app
     database`.

   db session
     The "session" is a SQLAlchemy abstraction for an open database
     connection, essentially.

     In practice this generally refers to a
     :class:`~wuttjamaican.db.sess.Session` instance.

   email handler
      The :term:`handler` responsible for sending email on behalf of
      the :term:`app`.

      Default is :class:`~wuttjamaican.email.handler.EmailHandler`.

   entry point
     This refers to a "setuptools-style" entry point specifically,
     which is a mechanism used to register "plugins" and the like.
     This lets the app / config discover features dynamically.  Most
     notably used to register :term:`commands<command>` and
     :term:`subcommands<subcommand>`.

     For more info see the `Python Packaging User Guide`_.

     .. _Python Packaging User Guide: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/

   handler
     Similar to a "plugin" concept but only *one* handler may be used
     for a given purpose.  See also :doc:`narr/handlers/index`.

   install handler
      The :term:`handler` responsible for installing a new instance of
      the :term:`app`.

      Default is :class:`~wuttjamaican.install.InstallHandler`.

   package
     Generally refers to a proper Python package, i.e. a collection of
     modules etc. which is installed via ``pip``.  See also
     :doc:`narr/install/pkg`.

   provider
     Python object which "provides" extra functionality to some
     portion of the :term:`app`.  Similar to a "plugin" concept; see
     :doc:`narr/providers/index`.

   settings table
     Table in the :term:`app database` which is used to store
     :term:`config settings<config setting>`.  See also
     :doc:`narr/config/table`.

   subcommand
     A top-level :term:`command` may expose one or more subcommands,
     for the overall command line interface.  Subcommands are usually
     the real workhorse; each can perform a different function with a
     custom arg set.  See also :doc:`narr/cli/index`.

   virtual environment
     This term comes from the broader Python world and refers to an
     isolated way to install :term:`packages<package>`.  See also
     :doc:`narr/install/venv`.
