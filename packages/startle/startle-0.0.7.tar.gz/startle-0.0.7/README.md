**startle** lets you transform a python function into a command line entry point, e.g:

`wc.py`:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Literal

from startle import start


def word_count(
    fname: Path, /, kind: Literal["word", "char"] = "word", *, verbose: bool = False
) -> None:
    """
    Count the number of words or characters in a file.

    Args:
        fname: The file to count.
        kind: Whether to count words or characters.
        verbose: Whether to print additional info.
    """

    text = open(fname).read()
    count = len(text.split()) if kind == "word" else len(text)

    print(f"{count} {kind}s in {fname}" if verbose else count)


start(word_count)
```

`❯ python wc.py --help`:

When you invoke `start`, it will construct an argparser (based on type hints and docstring),
parse the arguments, and invoke `word_count`.

`❯ python wc.py wc.py -k char --verbose`:

**startle** is inspired by [Typer](https://github.com/fastapi/typer), and [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire), but some decisions are done differently:

- Use of positional-only or keyword-only argument separators (`/`, `*`, see PEP 570, 3102) are naturally translated into positional arguments or options.
- Like Typer and unlike Fire, type hints strictly determine how the individual arguments are parsed and typed.
- Short forms (e.g. `-k`, `-v` above) are automatically provided based on the initial of the argument.
- Variable length arguments are more intuitively handled.
  You can use `--things a b c` (in addition to `--things=a --things=b --things=c`).
- Like Typer and unlike Fire, help is simply printed and not displayed in pager mode by default, so you can keep referring to it as you type your command.
- Like Fire and unlike Typer, docstrings determine the description of each argument in the help text, instead of having to individually add extra type annotations. This allows for a very non-intrusive design, you can adopt (or un-adopt) **startle** with no changes to your function.
- `*args` but also `**kwargs` are supported, to parse unknown arguments as well as unknown options (`--unk-key unk-val`).
