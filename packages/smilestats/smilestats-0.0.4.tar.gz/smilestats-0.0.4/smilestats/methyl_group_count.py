    Parameters
    ----------
    molecule : networkx.Graph
        The networkx.Graph created using pysmiles from a molecule containing (or
        not containing) a methylene group (CH3).
    safety : bool (default=True)
        If the checkbox is set to True, the calculations do not affect the transferred
        object - molecule. If the check box is set to False, it is assumed that the
        transmitted graph contains hydrogen atoms supported by pysmiles. Disabling
        safety mode can increase the speed of operation, but lead to errors if the data
        is not properly prepared.

    Returns
    -------
    ch3_count : int
        The number of methyl group (CH3) in the molecule.
