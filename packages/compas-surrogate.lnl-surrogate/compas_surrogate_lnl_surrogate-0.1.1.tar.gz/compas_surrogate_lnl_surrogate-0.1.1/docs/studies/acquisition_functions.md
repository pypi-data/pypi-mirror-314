# Bayesian Optimization for GPs



GPs can provide a reconstruction of an unknown function from sparse measurements

Additionally, the GP posterior predictive mean, $\mu$, and posterior predictive variance, $\sigma$, can be used to derive an _acquisition function_, $\alpha(\mu,\sigma)$. _Acquisition functions_ are useful in selecting the next point to observe from the model in optimization problems (active learning).


We can select the next point using:

$$
x_{next}= \underset{x}{\arg\max}\frac{1}{N_{\rm{mcmc}}}âˆ‘_{i=1}^{N_{\rm{mcmc}}} \alpha(\mu^i,\sigma^i)
$$

where
- $N_{\rm{mcmc}}$ is the total number of MCMC samples,
- $\mu^i$ is the _i_-th sample posterior predictive mean, and
- $\sigma^i$ is the _i_-th sample posterior predictive variance.


There are several acquisition functions that can be used.

## Acquisition functions

An acquisition function is a function that maps the posterior predictive mean and variance to a scalar value. The scalar value is used to select the next point to observe from the model.

In general, we will write the acquisition function as $\alpha(\mu,\sigma)$, where $\mu$ is the posterior predictive mean and $\sigma$ is the posterior predictive variance.

### Penalizing Recent Observations

We can add in a _penalty factor_ based on the recently observed points to avoid sampling the same region of the function space repeatedly.

This can be tacked on to _some_ acquisition function as follows:

$$
\alpha(\mu,\sigma) - \lambda\ \gamma(x, \vec{X_{\rm r}})
$$

where $\lambda$ is some penalty factor and $\gamma(x, \vec{X_{\rm r}})$ is the penalty for point $x$ based on their distance to the recently visited points $\vec{X_{\rm r}}$.


### The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)

The upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function is defined as

$$
\alpha_{\rm{UCB}}^i(\mu^i, \sigma^i)= \mu^i\pm\sqrt{\beta\ \sigma^i}\qquad
$$

The coefficient $\beta$ determines an exploitation-exploration trade-off.

```{note}
The primary goal of UCB is to find a global minima/maxima rather than to reconstruct the entire function accurately.

This is the same animation but with adding in a penalty factor:

A drawback of this method is that it requires an update of the GP model after each new observation. This can be computationally expensive.

Here are some more examples:

#### Batched UCB (qUCB)

In MCMC-based GP, we obtain a separate multivariate normal posterior for each set of sampled kernel hyperparameters.
Hence, we can create a separate UCB acquisition function for each posterior, and then acquire a batch of new points.

The following are two animations made with different random seeds (no penalty factor).

### Thompson Sampling

Thompson Sampling uses the following logic:

- Fit the GP to the observations we have
- Draw one GP sample (a function) from the posterior
- Greedily choose the next point x with respect to the sample

[See wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling)

As this method is probabilistic, it does not need to be updated after each new observation.

Here are some examples:

### Uncertainty-based exploration (UE)

This acquisition function aims at reducing the uncertainty of the GP model. It is defined as

$$
\alpha_{\rm{UE}}^i(\sigma^i)= \sigma^i
$$

and helps to explore the function space in regions of high uncertainty.

### Expected Improvement (EI)

This also focuses on the maximisation/minimisation of the GP's posterior predictive mean.
It looks for the best value of $\mu$ so far and then looks for the next point that has a higher probability of being better than the best value so far.

$$
\alpha_{\rm{EI}}^i(\mu^i, \sigma^i)= \sigma^i\ (u^i \mathcal{N}_{\rm CDF}(u^i) \mathcal{N}_{\rm PDF}(u^i)\ ,
$$

where $u^i = \frac{\mu^i - \mu_{\rm{best}}}{\sigma^i}$ and $\mu_{\rm{best}}$ is the best value of $\mu$ so far.
