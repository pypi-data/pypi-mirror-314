# Numerical 1st Order ODE Solver

This project is a Python implementation for solving first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerically. The script allows users to choose between two methods: Euler's Method and Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method (RK4), providing a visual representation of the solution.

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

Install missing dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install matplotlib sympy numpy
```

You can modify the script to add more methods, adjust default parameters, or change visualization settings.

This project is open-source and free to use. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
