/**
   \brief MCU pin model.

   Pin represents a external pad of the MCU used for GPIO.
   The pin has two electrical states given by the external circuit and the internal circuit (the GPIO port),
   which are resolved into a single electrical state. In case of conflict, the SHORTED state is
   set.
   Analog voltage levels are relative to VCC, hence limited to the range [0.0, 1.0].
