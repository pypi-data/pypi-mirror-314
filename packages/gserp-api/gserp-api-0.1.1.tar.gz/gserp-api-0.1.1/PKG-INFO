# SERP API

## Overview

The SERP API is an open-source project designed to perform search queries on Google and return organic search results. It leverages the `requests-ip-rotator` to handle IP rotation, ensuring that requests are made from different IP addresses to avoid being blocked by Google. The API is built using Python and provides a simple interface for querying and retrieving search results.

## Features

- **IP Rotation**: Utilizes `requests-ip-rotator` to rotate IP addresses for each request.
- **Customizable Search**: Allows specifying search parameters such as country, language, location, and fields to retrieve.
- **Field Selection**: Users can choose which fields to include in the search results, such as title, link, snippet, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages for invalid field selections and connection issues.
