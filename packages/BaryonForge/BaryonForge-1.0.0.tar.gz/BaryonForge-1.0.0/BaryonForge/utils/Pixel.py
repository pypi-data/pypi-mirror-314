class ConvolvedProfile(object):
    """
    A class to compute profiles convolved with a pixel window function.

    The `ConvolvedProfile` class takes in a `HaloProfile` object from `CCL` and a pixel window function object (eg. `HealPixel`)
    and returns a new object that computes profiles while including the pixel window function of the map that we paint into.
    It is assumed that the window function is isotropic. This class supports both real-space and projected-space profiles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Profile : object
        A `ccl.halos.profiles.HaloProfile` object that defines the halo profile to be convolved with the pixel window function.
    
    Pixel : object
        An object that defines the pixel window function. This object must provide `real()` and `projected()` methods
        to return the window function in real space and harmonic space, respectively. It must also have an `isHarmonic` attribute,
        to specify where the pixel scale is defined in angular space or physical space.

    Attributes
    ----------
    Profile : object
        The original profile object to be convolved with the pixel window function.
    
    Pixel : object
        The pixel window function object used to convolve the profile.
    
    fft_par : dict
        A dictionary of FFT log parameters used for Fourier transforms, derived from the `Profile` object.
    
    isHarmonic : bool
        A boolean indicating whether the pixel window function is defined in harmonic space.

    Methods
    -------
    real(cosmo, r, M, a)
        Computes the real-space profile convolved with the pixel window function.
    
    projected(cosmo, r, M, a)
        Computes the projected-space profile convolved with the pixel window function, accounting for harmonic space if applicable.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> profile = SomeHaloProfile()
    >>> pixel = SomePixelWindowFunction()
    >>> convolved_profile = ConvolvedProfile(profile, pixel)
    >>> result = convolved_profile.real(cosmo, r, M, a)
    >>> projected_result = convolved_profile.projected(cosmo, r, M, a)

    Notes
    -----
    - This class uses FFTLog for computing convolutions in Fourier space.
    - The `real` and `projected` methods perform clipping on the radius `r` to prevent artifacts like ringing at small scales.
    - The convolved profile is scaled by appropriate powers of \(2\pi\) to account for the transformations.

    """
    A class for approximating the window function of a grid's pixel as a circular tophat.

    The `GridPixelApprox` class provides methods to approximate the window function of a grid's pixel.
    In this approximation, the pixel window function is considered as a circular tophat in real space.
    This approximation is used to compute the effective window function in both real and projected spaces,
    for use in Fourier transforms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : float
        The size of the grid's square pixel, in comoving Mpc. 
        This size is used to compute the radius of the tophat approximation.

    Methods
    -------
    beam(k, R)
        Computes the beam function given a wavenumber `k` and a radius `R`.
    
    real(k)

    projected(k)
        Computes the projected-space approximation of the pixel window function for given wavenumbers `k`.

    Examples

    Notes
    -----
    - The `beam()` method uses the spherical Bessel function of the first kind (`spherical_jn`) to compute the beam function.

class HealPixel(object):
    """
    A class for approximating the window function of a HEALPix pixel using a Gaussian beam.

    The `HealPixel` class provides methods to approximate the window function of a HEALPix pixel. Instead of
    using the built-in HEALPix pixel window function, which is limited to `3 * NSIDE - 1`, this class uses a Gaussian
    beam approximation. The Gaussian beam, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) that is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
    smaller than the HEALPix pixel, provides a smooth window function for stable FFTLogs over a wide range of multipoles.

    The Gaussian beam \( B(k) \) is computed as:

    .. math::

        B(k) = \exp\left(-\\frac{k(k+1)\sigma^2}{2}\\right)

    where \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian beam, calculated as:

        A class-level attribute indicating whether the pixel window function is defined in harmonic space.

    NSIDE : int
        The NSIDE parameter of the HEALPix map, which determines the resolution.
    
    size : float
        The size (resolution) of a single pixel in the HEALPix grid, in radians.

    Methods
    -------
    real(k)
        Returns a zero array, indicating that the real-space representation of the pixel is not supported.
    
    projected(k)
        Computes the projected-space approximation of the pixel window function using a Gaussian beam.

    >>> projected_space_beam = heal_pixel.projected(k)

    Notes
    -----
    - The Gaussian beam used for approximation is designed to match the HEALPix pixel window function closely,
      with <0.1% deviation for most scales and about 1% at the smallest scales.

        The Gaussian beam \( B(k) \) is computed as:

        .. math::

            B(k) = \exp\left(-\\frac{k(k+1)\sigma^2}{2}\\right)

        where \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian beam, given by:

        .. math::

            \sigma = \\frac{\\text{size}}{\sqrt{8 \log(2)} \cdot \sqrt{2}}

        Parameters
        ----------
        k : ndarray
            An array of wavenumbers (or multipole moments) at which to evaluate the projected-space window function.

        Returns
        -------
        beam : ndarray
            An array representing the Gaussian beam values corresponding to the input wavenumbers.
        """
        
        sig  = hp.nside2resol(self.NSIDE) / np.sqrt(8 * np.log(2)) / np.sqrt(2)
        beam = np.exp(-k*(1 + k)/2 * sig**2)
        
        return beam
       
 
class NoPix(object):
    """
    A class representing no pixel effect, i.e., no convolution or smoothing.

    The `NoPix` class is used to simulate a scenario where there is no pixel window function applied,
    effectively representing a situation with no smoothing or convolution. This class is primarily
    used for testing purposes, allowing the evaluation of profiles without the influence of a pixel window
    function.

    Methods
    -------
    real(k)
        Returns an array of ones, representing no effect of a pixel window function in real space.
    
    projected(k)
        Returns an array of ones, representing no effect of a pixel window function in projected space.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> nopix = NoPix()
    >>> k = np.linspace(0.01, 1.0, 100)
    >>> real_space_response = nopix.real(k)  # Returns an array of ones
    >>> projected_space_response = nopix.projected(k)  # Returns an array of ones

    Notes
    -----
    - This class is useful for testing and comparison purposes, where the impact of pixel window functions
      needs to be isolated or excluded.
    - The `real()` and `projected()` methods return arrays of ones, indicating that there is no attenuation
      or modification of the input profile due to a pixel window function.
