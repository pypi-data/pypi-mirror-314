# Oqtant API (OqtAPI)

Oqtant offers a Python package that works with Jupyter notebooks to provide access to more complex experiments, fine-tuned control over job inputs, and more in-depth data analysis tooling.

With [Oqtant Quantum Matter Service](https://oqtant.infleqtion.com), create a form of quantum matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), wherein quantum phenomena are visible on a macroscopic scale. Using light, programmatically manipulate BECs to explore a multitude of phenomena: superposition, interference, tunneling, superfluidity, and more!

## ðŸš€ Installation

The easiest way to install Oqtant's Python API is via pip:

```shell
pip install oqtant
```

### Update

From a terminal, run:

```shell
pip install --upgrade oqtant
```

Or from within a Jupyter notebook, run:

```shell
%pip install --upgrade oqtant
```

To submit jobs, you will need an Oqtant account. [Register and start for free!](https://oqtant.infleqtion.com)
For more details, see the [Quick Start Guide](https://oqtant-docs.infleqtion.com/INSTALL)

## ðŸ§­ Introduction

After installing Oqtant's Python API, you can explore the [Example Jupyter Notebooks](https://oqtant-docs.infleqtion.com/examples/hello_world/). These notebooks will walk you through the functionality and capabilities of using the Oqtant API. Additionally, there is a growing library of [Demonstration Jupyter Notebooks](https://oqtant-docs.infleqtion.com/examples/demos/demo_1_quantum_interference/) for showing specific quantum phenomena on Oqtant (e.g. interference).

Oqtant's Python API contains tools to:

- Have the programmatic equivalent of the same job functionality as the [Oqtant Web App](https://oqtant.infleqtion.com), and more

- Build parameterized (i.e. optimization) experiments using OqtantJobs

- Submit and retrieve OqtantJob results

- Analyze OqtantJob results
