"""
Encode theory.

The encoder handles mapping a bit vector of length K, called s, to a codeword, called x, which will be of length N > K,
This transform is written s.G = x, where G is some generator matrix that creates the codeword.

For a code with parity check matrix H, whose codewords satisfy Hx = 0, the generator must satisfy H.G_transposed = 0

H is systematic when written in the form, H = [-Pt | I], where P is the parity matrix and I is the identity matrix
(and -Pt = Pt for binary). A systematic matrix is useful because its output will contain the original code

The systematic form of G is then given by G = [I | P]

Because we know I already, whenever we create the matrices we just need to find P

A further property of these matrices is that we want them to be linearly independent. This means that any two columns
added to each other cannot be equal to zero. We can use this property when generating matrices. Indeed the number of
columns that add to zero will be the overall hamming distance of the matrix!
