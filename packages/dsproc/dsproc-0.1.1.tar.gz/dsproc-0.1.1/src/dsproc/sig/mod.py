        fs: Sampling frequency. How often samples will be created for the wave. A wave with a sampling rate of 100Hz
            would have 100 samples per second.
        message: A numpy array of ints containing the message symbols which will be written into a wave.
        sps: How many samples to generate per symbol. Typical values are between 8 and 20. Lowering the samples
            per symbol will increase the data rate at the expense of making it more susceptible to errors.
        amplitude: The (approximate) max amplitude of the wave, typically 1.
        f: The centre frequency of the signal. Should be somewhere between -fs/2 and fs/2.

        """
        Frequency hopping spread spectrum, causes the signal to hop from frequency to frequency at a pre-define hop
        rate. Frequency hopping is made by multiplying the signal by a carrier wave that jumps to each different
        frequency. Note that FHSS doesn't encode any sort of pause, the wave simply hops directly from one frequency
        to another. This would make analog demodulation impossible, so if that is your aim you will have to
        input pauses.

        hop_f: How many hops per second there are, i.e. the hopping frequency. Higher hopping frequencies will require
            the receiver to retune at a faster rate to capture the transmit.

        freqs: A numpy array of ints of the frequencies that are to be hopped too. Note that the frequencies are
            additive with the center frequency of the signal. i.e. if the center frequency is 100Hz and the
            hop frequencies are [-50, 150], then the resultant hopped signal will be at -50Hz and then 250Hz.

        pattern: optional, np.array of int indices that align with some frequencies in the freqs parameter.
            The pattern is an optional parameter than can be defined to say what order the freqs list should be jumped
            through. e.g. [0, 2, 1] would start with the first frequency, then go to the 3rd, then the second.
