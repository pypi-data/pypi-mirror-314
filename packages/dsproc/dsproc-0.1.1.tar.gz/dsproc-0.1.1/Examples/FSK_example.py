Frequency shift keying example
"""

# Intermediate Hz, This will be the highest frequency that will occur in the modulated wave
f = 2000
fs = 8000   # Use a high sample rate so the fsk is easier to see in the time domain
sps = 16
# Our message in symbol form. In this example we have 4 symbols, so each symbol would typically represent 2 bits
# 0 = "00"
# 1 = "01"
# 2 = "10"
# 3 = "11" etc.
# Create a random message of 100 symbols with 4 levels
MESSAGE = dsproc.create_message(100, 4)


# Create the sig object with the given params
s = dsproc.Mod(message=MESSAGE, fs=fs, sps=sps, f=f)

# Apply the frequency shift keying
s.FSK(100)

# We can then explore the wave using the plot functions
# plot the first 400 samples in the time domain
# s.time(n=400)
# You can see from the fft that the wave hasn't been filtered at all
# s.fft()

# The wave is currently at 2000hz, we can baseband it with the baseband function
s.baseband()

# Note that the graphs have now changed.
# s.time()
# s.fft()
# s.psd()
# s.specgram(nfft=1024)

# the actual samples that we have generated can be explored
# You can see that they are complex 64 type, which can be thought of as x, y coordinates (kind of)
s.samples[0:20]

# This sample can then be saved and transmitted with GNU-radio or the USRP python interface. Doing it either way
# is very straightforward

# apply a frequency shift with the freq_offset method
s.freq_offset(freq=500)
# s.fft()
# baseband it
s.baseband()

# Saves the samples as complex64 (compatible with gnuradio/usrp)
#s.save("FSK_test")
