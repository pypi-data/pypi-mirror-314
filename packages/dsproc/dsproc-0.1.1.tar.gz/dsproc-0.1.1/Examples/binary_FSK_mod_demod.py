# Ok we have our wave and we need to demod it, ref:
# https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/digital-signal-processing-in-scilab-how-to-decode-an-fsk-signal
# We can demod FSk by multiplying it with a wave from the expected 0 frequency and the expected 1 frequency,
# average them, and that will produce a nice square wave of our symbols
# This uses the following identites:
#   sin(ω1t)∗sin(ω2t) = 1/2(cos((ω1−ω2)t) − cos((ω1+ω2)t))
#   cos(ω1t)∗cos(ω2t) = 1/2(cos((ω1−ω2)t) + cos((ω1+ω2)t))
# Which means that if our expected frequencies are correct we should get a spike at 1/2(cos(0)) - cos(0), which is 0.5
# or 1/2(cos(0) + cos(0) which is 1.5
