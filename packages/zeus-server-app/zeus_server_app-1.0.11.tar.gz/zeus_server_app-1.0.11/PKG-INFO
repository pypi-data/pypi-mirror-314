## Overview

The **Zeus Server App** is a server-side application designed to manage multiplayer bot lobbies for games like Call of Duty Black Ops 6. This module hosts a server to emulate gamepad strokes based on commands received from the Zeus Admin Panel. It is ideal for setups involving Virtual Machines (VMs).

## Features

- Hosts a server to listen for gamepad control commands.
- Requires Windows Firewall whitelisting for communication.
- HWID-based access control for enhanced security.
- Emulates gamepad inputs using upstream server commands.
- Provides an IP address to integrate with the Lobby Manager App.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
2. Install the Zeus Server App using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install zeus-server-app
   ```
3. Run the server module:
   ```bash
   python3 -m zeus_server_app
   ```

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:
- `vgamepad`
- `colorama`
- `requests`

These dependencies are automatically installed during the setup.

## Setup Guide

1. Add the HWID value generated by the **Zeus Admin Panel** to the server configuration.
2. Ensure the application is whitelisted in Windows Firewall.
3. Run the script on your virtual machine (VM) or physical machine.
4. Share the generated IP with the Lobby Manager app for integration.
