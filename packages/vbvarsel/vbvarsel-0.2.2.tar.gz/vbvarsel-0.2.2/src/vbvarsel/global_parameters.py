#Changed this over to a dataclass versus the previous function-based implementaton.
#Seemed to make more sense this way since I'm not really doing anything
#To the params once they are set, plus I don't like named tuples plus this
#Seems more easier to pass around, comes with as many dunder attribs as wanted
#And just seems like an overall better idea.

#Sphinx and Python is too smart and Dataclasses are already kind of self-documenting
# so we don't actually need all these doc strings and having it in there makes the rtd
# page absolutely fugly so they won't be included.

    # Attributes:
    #     threshold: float
    #         The threshold for simulation convergence. (Default: 1e-1)
    #     k1: int
    #         Maximum number of clusters to simulate for. (Default: 5)
    #     alpha0: float
    #         Prior coefficient count, also known as the concentration parameter for
    #         Dirichelet prior on the mixture proportions. This field is calculated
    #         from 1/k1. (Default: 0.2)
    #     a0: int
    #         Degrees of freedom for the Gamma prior on the cluster precision, which
    #         controls the shape of the Gamma distribution. A higher number results
    #         in a more peaked distribution. (Default: 3)
    #     beta0: float
    #         Shrinkage parameter of the Gaussian conditional prior on the cluster
    #         mean. This influences the tightness and spread of the cluster, smaller
    #         shrinkage leads to tighter clusters. (Default: 1e-3)
    #     d0: int
    #         Shape parameter of the Beta distribution on the probability. A value of
    #         1 results in a uniform distribution. (Default: 1)
    #     t_max: int
    #         Maximum starting annealing temperature. Value of 1 has no annealing.
    #         (Default: 1)
    #     max_itr: int
    #         Maximum number of iterations. (Default: 25)
    #     max_annealed_itr: int
    #         Maximum number of iterations for annealing, if applicable. (Default: 10)
    #     max_models: int
    #         Maximum number of models to run for averaging (Default: 10)
