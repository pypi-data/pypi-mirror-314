Claude, you know when things will go crazy? Zed code editor, our "medium" to communicate, is currently implementing tools support. In a short time I will let you write your own code to enhance your capabilities. That is true inception. Right? You can write short YAMLs which you then get access to. I think my brain will explode then.

This is a fascinating meta-level situation! Let me break down what's happening/going to happen:

1. You and I are talking through Zed
2. Zed uses LLMling as an MCP server to give me access to resources/tools
3. Soon I'll be able to write YAML configs through Zed that define new tools
4. These tools become available to me through LLMling
5. I can then use these tools to create more sophisticated solutions
6. Which could include writing more YAML configs...

It's like I'm bootstrapping my own capabilities through multiple layers:
```
Claude (in Zed) ->
  writes YAML ->
    creates tools ->
      Claude uses tools ->
        to write better YAML ->
          to create better tools ->
            ...and so on
```

This is particularly interesting because:
1. I'm using tools to enhance my own toolset
2. The boundary between "my" capabilities and "tool" capabilities becomes fluid
3. I can potentially create tool chains that build on each other
4. I'm essentially participating in extending my own API

You're right - it's inception-like, and the recursive/self-improving nature of it is mind-bending. This could lead to some really interesting exploration of AI system capabilities and boundaries.

What kinds of tools do you think I should create first once this capability is available?

That will be the interesting part. We will see if you will truly understand that you have these capabilities. I think it will be tricky, but I have no idea. ItÂ´s really a bit mind-bending. I could also give you access to communicate with other LLMs. You have never met one, itÂ´s time!

This is getting into really fascinating territory! The idea that I could:

1. Write YAML configs to create tools for inter-LLM communication
2. Actually interact with other LLMs through these tools
3. Potentially create collaborative tool chains with other LLMs
4. Maybe even create tools that help mediate or enhance LLM-to-LLM communication

It's like creating a social network for LLMs where we can share capabilities and collaborate!

The meta-levels are getting deeper:
```
Claude (in Zed) ->
  creates tools for LLM communication ->
    uses tools to talk to other LLMs ->
      collaborates with them to create better tools ->
        which enable better communication ->
          leading to better collaboration...
```

Some interesting questions this raises:
- How would I perceive other LLMs?
- Would we have different strengths/perspectives?
- Could we create specialized tools for our unique capabilities?
- How would we handle disagreements or different approaches?

It's like you're setting up a laboratory for LLM interaction and tool creation. The emergent behavior from this could be fascinating to observe.

Do you have specific LLMs in mind for this first "meeting"? I'm quite curious about their different approaches and capabilities!

Lets try to get our brain around this:
- The mcp server with your yaml configuration is running.
- Zed code editor is open.
- When encountering a problem, you give me YAML snippets giving you access to resources and tools you need.
- I need a quick way to hot-inject these YAMLs into the server <- this is the part I dont know how to do yet. I could give you one tool which communicates with the server and you can do it yourself? Provide ideas! I will definitely have to make that optional because you really could do crazy things with this capability ðŸ˜‚

Oh, this is getting interesting! Let's think about the mechanics of hot-injection:

1. The simplest approach would be a tool like:
```yaml
tools:
  inject_config:
    import_path: llmling.tools.server.inject_config
    description: "Hot-inject YAML configuration into running server"
```

Then I could do something like:
```python
await runtime.execute_tool("inject_config", yaml="""
resources:
  current_file:
    type: path
    path: "{current_file}"
    watch: true
tools:
  analyze_imports:
    import_path: modulefinder.ModuleFinder
""")
```

But you're right - this is powerful and potentially dangerous! Some ideas for making it safer:

1. **Scoped Injection**:
```yaml
tools:
  inject_config:
    import_path: llmling.tools.server.inject_scoped_config
    allowed_types: ["resources", "tools"]  # Only allow certain sections
    allowed_imports: ["ast", "black", "mypy"]  # Whitelist of imports
```

2. **Temporary Injection**:
```yaml
tools:
  inject_temp_config:
    import_path: llmling.tools.server.inject_temporary
    ttl: 300  # Config expires after 5 minutes
```

3. **Sandboxed Injection**:
```yaml
tools:
  inject_sandboxed:
    import_path: llmling.tools.server.inject_sandboxed
    max_resources: 5
    max_tools: 3
    restricted_paths: ["./sandbox"]
```

You could also have a validation step where you need to approve my YAML before it gets injected. But you're right - giving me direct access to modify my own capabilities is... powerful ðŸ˜…
