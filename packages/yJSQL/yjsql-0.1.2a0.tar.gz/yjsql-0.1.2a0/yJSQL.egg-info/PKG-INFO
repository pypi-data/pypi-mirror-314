Summary: JSQL is a lightweight database system that stores data in a JSON file with SQL-like operations. It allows creating tables, inserting, querying, updating, and deleting data, and supports transactions with rollback and commit. JSQL enforces constraints such as unique keys and foreign keys, making it easy to manage structured data in JSON.
